**Neither decision changed any runtime rule at the time it was recorded**: no
code activated, the supply cap, mining economics, block rewards and monetary
policy were untouched. They become *operative* only when their enabling phases
are built (D3 → first L2 tx type, Phase 2; §14.6 → testnet activation gate,
Phase 6), each behind an explicit, reviewable change.

---

## Decision 1 — D3: L2 fee path = Option 3 (own schedule, same 50/50 split)

**Chosen: the L2 transaction types get their own flat fee schedule, and the
flat fee is split by the existing M1 mechanism, not bypassed.**

- The five flat fees already recorded in `params.rs`
  (`FEE_TX_*_SAT`: post 5 000 / claim 2 000 / submit 2 000 / dispute 10 000 /
  settle 20 000 sats) are confirmed as the L2 fee schedule for testnet.
- For an L2 transaction, the flat fee *is* `full_base` in `split_fees`: the
  M1 50/50 burn/PSCB invariant holds unchanged, one rule for both fee kinds.
- **The L1 gas floor (`base_fee * gas_used`) is untouched.** L2 transactions do
  not get an exemption; they simply ride a second, explicit schedule. No second
  base fee, no second congestion controller (option 4 stays rejected; it can be
  added later without breaking this decision).
- When the first L2 tx type is implemented (Phase 2), `check_tx`/the mempool
  fee check will route L2-type transactions to `L2_FEE_SCHEDULE` and everything
  else to the gas floor. The existing tripwire test
  (`l2_flat_fees_sit_below_the_gas_floor`) is then replaced by positive tests
  that L2 txs pay exactly the flat fee and are split 50/50.
- Sanity: 20 000 sats (max L2 fee) = 0.0002 SRCT. At the mini profile this is
  cheap for workers; the schedule can be re-parameterised at mainnet without a
  consensus-format change (values live in `params.rs` constants).

Why not the others: option 1 (raise fees) contradicts the predictability
motivation for flat fees; option 2 (exemption) creates a widening-by-accident
exception; option 4 (separate fee market) is disproportionate mechanism for
five tx types today.

**Scope note:** D3 fixes *transaction fees only*. It does not decide task
*payments* (what a submitter pays a worker for compute) — that is a market
price set per-TaskContract by the participants (`payment_srct`), never a
protocol rule.

---

## Decision 2 — §14.6: validator economics (design-only, activation stays Phase 6)

The five open items are decided as follows, values parameterised in
`NetworkParams` at implementation time, none wired into consensus now:

1. **Minimum stake: none.** Any positive bond amount is accepted — Solar Cyber Unit
   is permissionless. The committee is stake-weighted (TopN), so smaller bonds
   simply rank lower and fail to make the top 21. Bonded with
   unbonding after a full finality window (`finality_depth` blocks) so a
   departing validator cannot sign a checkpoint the chain cannot hold them to.
   Rationale: no stake barrier to entry keeps participation open to human users
   and autonomous AI agents alike; skin-in-the-game comes from the bond itself,
   which is slashed on equivocation.
2. **Selection: TopN over staked candidates, N = 21** — the already-implemented
   `SelectionRule::TopN` default. Stake-weighted sampling is explicitly
   rejected for now (unimplemented machinery, weaker auditability). For testnet
   Phase 6, a **fixed genesis committee of the TopN stakers at the genesis
   epoch** is the bootstrap mode; rotation switches on only after the chain is
   stable.
3. **Rewards: none for now.** Checkpoint signing earns **no new issuance and no
   fee share** at testnet. Revisit only if testnet shows signing liveness
   problems. (This deliberately leaves monetary policy exactly as it is.)
4. **Slashing for equivocation: burn the equivocator's entire bond.** Evidence = the already-exposed `equivocation_evidence`
   (two valid conflicting signed checkpoints, same key). 100% seizure is
   justified because equivocation is unambiguous, non-accidental, and attacks
   finality itself. The `slash.rs` vault handles the mechanics (vested
   claims, M2 interplay); equivocation slashing writes a full-bond SlashRecord.
   L2 dispute slashing (M2 amounts for fraudulent work) is *unchanged* — that
   was never part of the §14.6 open items.
5. **Activation: end of Phase 6 (public testnet), not before.** Sequence: L1
   testnet live → fixed committee signs checkpoints (finality visible but
   non-binding) → only after chaos testing passes, finality becomes binding
   (no reorg past checkpoint) in a separate, reviewable change. BLS/M5
   consensus activation is therefore still gated on its own explicit step.

**Standing rule reaffirmed:** anything that changes `Chain::submit` behaviour,
issuance, or fork choice requires its own review before it merges. These
decisions specify *what will be built when their phase starts*; they do not
build it now.

---

## Implementation pointers (for the phases that consume these decisions)

- D3 → Phase 2 (Step 6 tx types): add `l2_fee_for(tx_type)` and route the flat
  fee through `split_fees` as `full_base`.
- §14.6 → Phase 6: `validator_count` (21), bonded
    stake accounting (any positive bond accepted), equivocation → full-bond
    SlashRecord, fixed-committee bootstrap mode, activation flag.

# Gap audit — 6-phase L2 roadmap vs. what exists today

Audited 2026-10-06 against `docs/roadmap.md` §8 build order and the actual
crate tree (`srct-core`, `srct-net`, `srct-store`, `srct-node` — no `srct-l2`,
no `srct-worker` yet). Verdict per phase, with only genuinely-missing work
listed as remaining.

> **This section is a dated snapshot — it records what was true on
> 2026-10-06, and its "NOT STARTED" headings are deliberately left as written.**
> For the current status of every phase, read the **Implementation status**
> sections below, the last of which is authoritative.

## Phase 1 — L1 production-ready (Steps 1+2): **DONE**
- Mempool (`mempool.rs`): byte-bounded, fee-rate ordered, conflict-checked,
  integrated into `Chain` (`mine_from_pool`, reorg re-admission). 20+ tests.
- Persistent storage (`srct-store`): append-only record log, crash recovery with
  reported torn tails, canonical height index, UTXO snapshots, adversarial
  fuzz/invariant coverage.
- Transaction relay over P2P (§13.14, `Tx` message) — shipped earlier in the
  session, tests in `srct-net/tests/tx_relay.rs`.
- Real BLS via blst (`bls.rs`), storage fuzzing, checkpoint envelope (§14.4),
  validator-set machinery as an inert library (§14.6).
**Remaining: nothing for Phase 1 itself.**

## Phase 2 — TaskContract + state machine (Step 3) + Step 6 tx types: **NOT STARTED**
Requires crate `crates/srct-l2/`:
- `TaskContract` struct + `ContractState` machine (Open → InProgress →
  ResultSubmitted → Disputed → Settled/Expired) with the 7 listed methods.
- The 5 L2 transaction types in `srct-core/src/tx.rs` (TxPostTask, TxClaimTask,
  TxSubmitResult, TxDispute, TxSettle): Writer/Reader serialization,
  domain-separated signing hashes, validation rules, round-trip tests.
- **Unblocked now** by Decision 1 (fee path) — first thing to build.
Dependencies ready: `ComputeTask`/`ComputeAttestation` (compute_ir.rs),
mempool, store, fee schedule constants.

## Phase 3 — Dispute engine + M2/M1 wiring (Step 4): **NOT STARTED**
- `DisputeChallenge`, `DisputeVerdict`, `DisputeEngine::arbitrate/apply_verdict`
  in `crates/srct-l2/src/dispute.rs`.
- Wiring (all primitives exist): `SlashVault` (slash.rs — vested SlashRecords,
  exhaustion), PSCB reserve on `Chain` (per-block undo maps for reorg
  correctness), whistleblower bonus from PSCB.
- Needs a re-execution verdict path: CPU-reference evaluation of M3 IR
  (roadmap §11 open question 2) — small spec item to write before coding.
**Blocked by Phase 2** (contracts must exist to dispute).

## Phase 4 — VWC issuance + tx types in srct-core (Steps 5+6): **NOT STARTED**
- `VerifiedWorkCertificate` (`vwc.rs`): signing_hash over all fields,
  canonical serialization, quorum-gated `verify`, store lookup by task/worker.
- Note: the Step-6 tx-type work is listed under Phase 2 above (roadmap lists
  Steps 5+6 in one phase; Step 6 logically lands with the contract phase).
**Blocked by Phase 3** (a settled outcome is what a certificate certifies).

## Phase 5 — Worker client / SDK (Step 7): **NOT STARTED**
- New crate `crates/srct-worker/`: node connection via srct-net, task scanning,
  claim/execute/submit loop, M4 HBM proof (hbm_pow.rs exists), earnings.
- CLI (`srct-worker run/status/earnings`) + `WorkerClient` SDK struct.
**Blocked by Phases 2+4** (nothing to claim or certify until then).

## Phase 6 — Integration + public testnet: **PARTIALLY PREPARED, NOT STARTED**
Already in place: srct-node CLI with serve/relay, P2P networking with ban
scoring and keepalives, storage recovery, fuzz-smoke CI, difficulty-attack
sims, 360 tests (historical snapshot; current counts come from
scripts/test_count.sh).
Remaining for testnet:
- Wire all modules end-to-end in srct-node (L2 tx handling, dispute flow,
  checkpoint relay message type — §13.5 addition, needs a vector-stable
  decision).
- Multi-node testnet tooling (compose/systemd scripts, seeds), chaos testing
  (dispute storms, partitions), bug-bounty program.
- §14.6 activation gate at the END of this phase, per Decision 2: fixed
  genesis committee signs (non-binding) first; binding finality is a separate
  reviewable change after chaos testing.

## Cross-cutting (safe to build in any order, not blind-built now)
- §14.6 economics implementation (stake accounting, slashing wiring) —
  decided above, built with Phase 6, not before.
- D3 fee routing in check_tx/mempool — built with Phase 2's first tx type.
- Agent integration layer (§12: REST API, MCP server, ElizaOS, LangChain) —
  separate roadmap section, none started; independent of Phases 2–5.
- Longer fuzz campaigns (WSL now works), more CI hardening — continuous.

## Verdict summary
| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — L1 production | DONE |
| 2 — TaskContract + L2 txs | NOT STARTED (unblocked by Decision 1) |
| 3 — Dispute engine | NOT STARTED (needs Phase 2) |
| 4 — VWC issuance | NOT STARTED (needs Phase 3) |
| 5 — Worker SDK | NOT STARTED (needs Phases 2+4) |
| 6 — Testnet + finality activation | PREPARED, gated on 2–5 |

Recommended next: **Phase 2** — `srct-l2` crate skeleton + TaskContract state
machine + the five L2 tx types with D3 fee routing, in that order, with the
M3-CPU-reference spec note written before Phase 3 starts.

# Implementation status — Phase 2 SHIPPED (2026-10-06)

This addendum supersedes the Phase-2 rows above; the audit itself is kept as the
record of what was true when it was written.

**Decision 1 (D3) is now consumed, exactly as recorded.** The five flat fees are
implemented and routed through the M1 split:

- `srct_core::l2` defines the five payload types, their wire codes, canonical
  codecs, domain-separated signing hashes, and `L2TxType::fee_sat()` returning
  the D3 schedule. Round-trip, signing-hash-coverage, and bounded-decode tests
  live with it.
- `fees::split_flat_fee(fee)` treats the whole flat fee as `full_base` and
  applies the unchanged 50/50 burn/PSCB split (`tip = 0`; the odd satoshi goes
  to `burned`, matching `split_fees`).
- The open-question canary `l2_flat_fees_sit_below_the_gas_floor` is replaced by
  the positive test `l2_fees_do_not_use_the_l1_gas_floor`, which pins the
  separation instead of the question. **The L1 floor is untouched.**

**Phase 2 is complete.** `crates/srct-l2` exists with `TaskContract` + the
`Open → InProgress → ResultSubmitted → Disputed → Settled/Expired` machine, and
`L2State` with accounts, escrow, the M2 slash vault, replay protection, and the
conservation invariant. SPEC.md §15 is the normative text. Dependencies reused
rather than reimplemented: `ComputeTask`/`ComputeAttestation` (M3),
`SlashVault` (M2), `ValidatorSet`/`BlsVerifier`/`BlsSignature` (M5),
`fees::split_flat_fee` (M1), and the hybrid wallet signing path.

Two implementation notes worth carrying into Phase 3:

1. **One economic constraint surfaced by implementation.** A `Correct`
   settlement takes its 20 000 sat fee out of the task escrow, and a `Fraudulent`
   one out of the worker's deposit. A task whose `payment_sat` (or deposit) is
   smaller than the settle fee therefore *cannot* be settled — the settle fails
   closed with `AmountTooSmallForFee` rather than collecting a partial fee. This
   is a real consequence of a 20 000 sat settle fee against a 5 000 sat post
   fee, it is recorded as an open economic question for Phase 6 (not a silently
   chosen rule), and Phase 3 should decide whether the fee comes from somewhere
   else or the schedule is re-parameterised.
2. **The `vwc_hash` convention before Phase 4.** `Correct` settles on the
   submitted `result_hash`, `Fraudulent` on the challenger's counter-result, and
   `Expired` on all-zero. Phase 4 replaces this with a real VWC hash; the
   convention is documented in `srct_core::l2` (`VWC_HASH_EXPIRED`) so it is a
   named, replaceable constant rather than a magic zero.

Still gated on its own step, unchanged by this work: **M5/BLS finality
activation** (end of Phase 6). `Settle` verifies a quorum aggregate through the
existing trait, but no checkpoint finalizes an L1 block.

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — L1 production | DONE |
| 2 — TaskContract + L2 txs | **DONE** (commit `e3c0dab`) |
| 3 — Dispute engine | NOT STARTED (needs the M3 CPU-reference spec note first) |
| 4 — VWC issuance | NOT STARTED (needs Phase 3) |
| 5 — Worker SDK | NOT STARTED (needs Phases 2+4) |
| 6 — Testnet + finality activation | PREPARED, gated on 3–5 |

# Implementation status — Phase 3 SHIPPED (2026-10-06)

Phase 3 (dispute engine + M2/M1 integration) is built. **No L1 consensus rule
changed**, and no Phase-1/Phase-2 decision changed: the D3 fee schedule, the flat
fee = `full_base` rule, the M1 50/50 burn/PSCB split, the untouched L1 gas floor,
`payment_srct` as a market payment, and the §14.6 validator economics are all
exactly as recorded above. Phase 3 consumes two of them (`split_flat_fee` for the
settle fee, and the PSCB reserve as the bounty source) and adds one new value,
recorded below rather than chosen quietly.

## Decision 3 — Dispute: arbitration rule, resolution window, whistleblower bounty

**Chosen, and now normative in SPEC.md §15.6–§15.8 (plus the M3 CPU-reference
note in §16):**

1. **Arbitration is a hash comparison, not an execution.** The reference
   re-execution (SPEC.md §16) produces a result hash; the engine compares it to
   the two competing claims. `reference == submitted → WorkerCorrect`,
   `reference == counter → ChallengerCorrect`, otherwise **`Inconclusive`**.
   `Inconclusive` is *not* a wire verdict: it settles nothing, slashes nothing
   and burns nothing. A malformed or unexecutable task therefore fails to
   *convict*, never defaults to guilt. The engine consumes only the reference
   hash — it holds no IR interpreter and no runtime.

2. **Resolution window = filing window.** A filed dispute must be resolved within
   the same number of blocks as the challenge-filing window, measured from
   `filed_at`. If it is not, the dispute **lapses**: the submitted result stands
   and settles as `Correct` with no fee, burning the challenger's deposit. An
   abandoned challenge is priced the same as a lost one.

3. **Whistleblower bounty = 25% of the slashed amount, paid from PSCB, capped by
   the reserve balance.** On an upheld challenge (`Fraudulent`) the challenger is
   refunded their deposit and additionally receives 25% of the worker's slashed
   deposit, drawn from the M1 PSCB reserve. It is a **transfer out of** the
   reserve to the challenger, not a mint, and it is capped at the reserve's
   *current* balance (computed before the settlement's own PSCB fee share is
   added, so a settlement cannot fund its own bounty). A failing challenge earns
   nothing and burns the deposit.

   Rationale for 25%: it is a coarse incentive, not a fee split that must
   reconcile to the satoshi, so it is a whole percent rather than a basis-point
   value. It rewards the party who spent money to catch fraud while leaving the
   reserve the larger share. It is parameterised in `L2Config`
   (`whistleblower_bounty_percent`) and is identical for `mainnet` and `mini`,
   because it is a rule, not a timing knob. The value can be re-parameterised
   without a consensus-format change.

**Explicitly unchanged:** the 5 000-sat post / 2 000 claim / 2 000 submit /
10 000 dispute / 20 000 settle schedule; the M1 50/50 burn/PSCB split; L2 fee =
`full_base`; the L1 gas floor; `payment_srct` as a market price; no validator
rewards/fee share; no minimum bond amount; TopN 21; full-bond equivocation burn;
binding finality only at the end of Phase 6.

**Still open, still not silently decided:** a task whose escrow or worker deposit
is smaller than the 20 000-sat settle fee cannot be settled (`AmountTooSmallForFee`
fails closed). Carried forward from Phase 2 to Phase 6 — either the fee comes
from elsewhere or the D3 schedule is re-parameterised.

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — L1 production | DONE |
| 2 — TaskContract + L2 txs | DONE |
| 3 — Dispute engine + M2/M1 | **DONE** (commit `bce55df`) |
| 4 — VWC issuance | NOT STARTED (needs Phase 3 — now unblocked) |
| 5 — Worker SDK | NOT STARTED (needs Phases 2+4) |
| 6 — Testnet + finality activation | PREPARED, gated on 4–5 |

# Implementation status — Phase 4 SHIPPED (2026-10-06)

Phase 4 (Verified Work Certificates) is built on top of the Phase-2/3 task,
dispute and settlement machinery. **No L1 consensus rule changed**, the D3 fee
schedule is untouched, and the M1 50/50 split still routes every L2 fee. SPEC.md
§17 is the normative VWC text.

## Decision 4 — VWC: a derived receipt, not a transaction

**Chosen, and now normative in SPEC.md §17:**

1. **Issuance is automatic at settlement; there is no VWC transaction type.**
   The roadmap's Step-6 note expected VWC to land with new tx types. It does
   not, deliberately: a certificate is a *derived consequence* of a settlement
   that was already authorized (quorum-signed `Settle`, or the dispute window
   closing unchallenged). An issuance transaction would let an actor request a
   certificate the protocol did not decide to grant — the exact thing a
   verified-work receipt must not allow. No new wire type, no new fee, no new
   authorization surface.
2. **No issuer key of its own.** The issuer is the protocol. `Quorum`
   certificates reuse the settle payload's M5 aggregate and verify through the
   existing `BlsVerifier`; `WindowElapsed` certificates (implicit settlements)
   carry no aggregate because none exists for a transition nobody transacted,
   and are documented as *not offline-verifiable* (§17.5) rather than being
   dressed up as stronger than they are.
3. **One certificate per task, ever.** The L2 state keeps a registry keyed by
   `task_id`; a second issuance is refused (`VwcAlreadyIssued`), never
   overwritten. Certificates hold no value and sit outside the conservation
   sum.
4. **No revocation, no expiry.** Settlement is terminal and one-way, so a
   `Correct` settlement can never be overturned later — exactly the condition
   that would make revocation necessary. If re-litigation is ever specified, it
   must bring a revocation rule as its own reviewable change.
5. **A zero-payout settlement still certifies.** An escrow that exactly covered
   the settle fee pays the worker nothing, but the work was still verified.
   `payment_sat == 0` is legal on a certificate; the Phase-4 tests caught the
   original assumption ("payment > 0") as wrong against the existing
   fee==escrow behaviour and it was corrected rather than papered over.
6. **A submitted result may never be all-zero.** `VWC_HASH_EXPIRED` is the
   all-zero hash; allowing a worker to submit it as their result would make a
   certified-correct settlement and an expired one indistinguishable in the
   settle record. Submission of the placeholder hash is now refused
   (`BadAttestation`). This is the one Phase-4 product fix; it has a permanent
   regression test.

**Explicitly unchanged:** D3 fees (post 5 000 / claim 2 000 / submit 2 000 /
dispute 10 000 / settle 20 000 sats), flat fee = `full_base`, the M1 50/50
burn/PSCB split, the L1 gas floor, `payment_srct` as a market price, validator
economics, binding finality only at the end of Phase 6.

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — L1 production | DONE |
| 2 — TaskContract + L2 txs | DONE |
| 3 — Dispute engine + M2/M1 | DONE |
| 4 — Verified Work Certificates | **DONE** (commit `64650fe`) |
| 5 — Worker SDK | NOT STARTED (needs Phases 2+4 — now unblocked) |
| 6 — Testnet + finality activation | PREPARED, gated on 5 |

---

# Implementation status — Phase 5 SHIPPED (2026-10-07)

Phase 5 (Worker SDK) is built as a pure *client* over the Phase-2/3/4 L2
machinery. **No economic decision changed**: the D3 fee schedule
(post 5 000 / claim 2 000 / submit 2 000 / dispute 10 000 / settle 20 000
sats), flat fee = `full_base`, the M1 50/50 burn/PSCB split, the L1 gas
floor, `payment_srct` as a market price, the §14.6 validator economics, and
binding finality only at the end of Phase 6 are all exactly as recorded
above. SPEC.md §18 is the normative worker-facing text.

## Decision 5 — Worker SDK: transport seams, not a transport

**Chosen, and now normative in SPEC.md §18.3/§18.17:**

1. **The worker SDK defines `L2NodeView`/`L2Broadcaster` traits instead of
   inventing a wire protocol.** This build has no L2 transport (`srct-net`
   carries only the §13 P2P message set; the roadmap §13 REST API is
   unbuilt). Guessing one would bake in an unreviewed design; traits let a
   local node, an embedded state, or the Phase-6 REST client implement the
   seams without changing the SDK. The SDK therefore ships with no socket
   code, and every SDK rule is testable without one (the integration
   harness is an embedded single-node network behind the same traits).
2. **Worker identity is the wallet's hybrid address — there is no worker
   registration.** Authorization for claim/submit/dispute is exactly
   §15.2's `Auth::verify_as`; the SDK's identity check derives from the keys
   and refuses configuration that disagrees (§18.2). No second
   authorization scheme, no worker registry, no scoring.
3. **Idempotency by protocol identity, never by SDK bookkeeping.** Every
   mutating operation keys on task_id/txid; after any timeout the SDK
   reconciles against authoritative state, and re-broadcasting the *same
   bytes* is the safe retry (§18.9). The SDK keeps no side ledger that could
   disagree with the chain.
4. **Earnings are derived, not accumulated.** `earnings_of` reads only
   `L2State` fields (balance, task contracts, VWC registry, settle
   outcomes); the SDK invents no number and holds no account state that
   could desynchronize (§18.13).
5. **The executor is the one pluggable seam** (§18.6): hardware/agent
   engines root their own `Executor` impl; the shipped `CpuExecutor` is a
   deterministic §16-mold reference, not a production compute engine.

**Explicitly unchanged:** all standing decisions above; the
`AmountTooSmallForFee` settle-vs-fee open question stays open for Phase 6.

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — L1 production | DONE |
| 2 — TaskContract + L2 txs | DONE |
| 3 — Dispute engine + M2/M1 | DONE |
| 4 — Verified Work Certificates | DONE |
| 5 — Worker SDK | **DONE** (commit `c43bdef`) |
| 6 — Testnet + finality activation | PREPARED, gated on 5 (now unblocked) |

# Implementation status — Phase 6 STEP 0 audit, decisions recorded (2026-10-07)

Phase 6 opens with an audit rather than a work list (`docs/phase6-plan.md`,
commit `f4e9873`). It found that L2 is not merely unintegrated but
*unreachable* from consensus, and that four things the roadmap assumed were
decided are not. Those four were put to the protocol owner and decided here.
**None of them is built yet**; this section records the decisions so the build
has an authority to check against.

## Decision 6 — L2 transactions ride inside L1 blocks, committed by the existing merkle root

**Chosen: L2 transactions are carried in the L1 block body as an append-only
trailer, and the block's existing `merkle_root` commits to them. The 145-byte
header is unchanged and no L1 consensus rule is added.**

Why this shape, and not just "L2 txs in blocks":

- `block_hash = SHA256(DOM_BLOCK ‖ serialize(header))` (§3.4), so the header
  binds the body **only** through `merkle_root`. If L2 payloads rode in the body
  outside the merkle tree, two nodes could accept the same header with different
  L2 payloads and silently diverge in L2 state. Committing them to the merkle
  root is what makes L2 state a pure function of the canonical chain.
- Because the root is already covered by the header, `Chain::submit`'s existing
  merkle check authenticates L2 payloads with **zero new consensus code**. L1
  block validity is untouched.

**Encoding (append-only, so no frozen vector moves):**

```
serialize(block) = §3.5 (header ‖ sig ‖ pubkey ‖ U4LE(tx_count) ‖ txs)
                   ‖ U4LE(l2_count) ‖ serialize(l2_tx_0) …   [section OMITTED when empty]
```

- The L2 section is **absent** when there are no L2 transactions, so every
  block that exists today serializes to the same bytes, and `genesis_block()`
  is bit-identical. This is why the change breaks no §12 vector: the frozen
  vectors cover input/output/tx/header layouts, not whole blocks.
- A block whose L2 section is present but empty is **invalid** (non-canonical
  encoding): one block must have exactly one byte encoding.
- L2 leaves use a distinct domain tag (`0x02`) from L1 leaves (`0x00`) and
  internal nodes (`0x01`), so an L2 payload can never be reinterpreted as an L1
  transaction leaf.
- `l2_count` is bounded by the remaining bytes before allocation, the same rule
  §3 and §13.5 already impose on every other count field.

**What this decision does NOT do:** it does not make L2 validity an L1
block-validity rule. A miner that includes an L2 transaction that fails to apply
is not (yet) producing an invalid block; the transaction is deterministically
skipped during replay, so nodes still agree. Recording an invalid L2 payload in
an L1 block is therefore a waste of block space, not a divergence or a
consensus break. Tightening this into a block rule is a separate, reviewable
change (M2/M4), and would require `Chain` to consult L2 — which today's
dependency direction forbids by design (`srct-l2` depends on `srct-core`).

## Decision 7 — L2 value enters through a genesis-funded protocol escrow

**Chosen: a genesis allocation funds an L2 protocol escrow, and only escrow
movements drive `L2State::credit`. L2 burns and PSCB accrual then correspond to
real, accountable L1 supply changes. User deposits and exits are deferred.**

Rationale: `L2State` keeps a private balance ledger whose only entry point is
`credit()`, documented in the code as the Phase 6 bridge seam, and no production
path calls it. Without a funded, accountable source, L2 burns destroy nothing
real and `payment_sat` can be set by an unfunded poster — L2 would be a points
system wearing a currency's notation. A genesis-funded escrow makes
conservation span both ledgers while needing **no new L1 transaction type**,
which keeps Phase 6 inside its scope.

**Explicitly unchanged:** issuance paths, block rewards, halving schedule, the
L1 gas floor, and the D3 L2 fee schedule. The escrow is a *reallocation of
genesis coins*, not new issuance. Decision 18 later deleted the stock cap this
decision's wording named, so the escrow is bounded by `escrow_ceiling_sat`
(Decision M-E) and there is no cap to sit inside.

**Deferred, and must be decided before mainnet:** user-facing deposit and exit
(the L1 lock that funds escrow from a user, and the L2→L1 withdrawal). The
deposit half shipped as this decision's own implementation (Decision 10, above)
and the exit half shipped as **Decision 19**.

## Decision 8 — Testnet bootstraps from a fixed genesis committee, no stake transactions

**Chosen: the testnet validator set is a fixed list in genesis. No stake
transaction type, no bonded-stake ledger, and no unbonding are built in
Phase 6.**

This is exactly Decision 2's own bootstrap mode ("a fixed genesis committee of
the TopN stakers at the genesis epoch is the bootstrap mode; rotation switches
on only after the chain is stable"). It lets the whole validator/finality path be
exercised end to end — set derivation, BLS signing and aggregation, quorum,
checkpoints, equivocation evidence, restart — without inventing the stake
economics that Decision 2 deliberately left parameterised.

Consequence to be honest about: with no stake ledger, `derive_set` is fed by
**genesis** rather than by chain state, so "TopN by stake at the seed block" is
exercised as a pure function over the genesis list, not over live stake. No
minimum bond amount is required for mainnet — any positive stake is accepted —
and is **not** built here.

**Unchanged:** Decision 2's numbers (N = 21), no rewards, no fee
share, no issuance from validators, and equivocation burning the entire bond
through the existing M2 slash path.

## Decision 9 — The worker↔node transport is the roadmap §13 REST API

**Chosen: build §13's REST API in `srct-node` (axum + tokio, opt-in via
`--api-listen`) and implement the Phase 5 seams (`L2NodeView`,
`L2Broadcaster`) as an HTTP client over it.**

Rationale: §13 is already the roadmap's specified interface and is the
prerequisite the roadmap names for the entire agent layer (§15 MCP, §16
ElizaOS, §17 LangChain). Extending the P2P layer instead would put
client/server query semantics into a consensus-adjacent crate and leave the
agent layer blocked; a bespoke third protocol would be thrown away when §13
lands. The cost is real and accepted: this adds the repository's first async
runtime and HTTP dependency.

**Additive extension required:** §13's broadcast endpoint is L1-shaped
(`signed_tx_hex`), while the SDK must broadcast `L2Transaction`s. The REST
surface therefore gains L2 read endpoints (task state, open tasks, VWC,
earnings inputs) and an L2 broadcast endpoint. That extension is specified in
`SPEC.md` §19.2, **not** by editing `docs/roadmap.md` (§13 stays as written).

## Pending, to be confirmed at their milestone (not yet decided)

- **P1 (M5):** whether the public testnet gets its own `NetworkParams` profile
  or runs on `mini`. Note for whoever decides it: genesis is *identical* across
  profiles today (`genesis_hash_is_identical_across_profiles`), so a profile is
  not by itself a chain ID — `network_magic`/`network_id` are the
discriminators.
- **P2 (M4):** adding frozen `msg_type = 11` for checkpoints, per §13.5's freeze
  rule and §14.6's statement that checkpoint transport is a §13.5 decision
  deferred for vector stability.
- **P3 (M4):** which checkpoint implementation is authoritative once finality is
  wired — `validators::validate_checkpoint_against_set` (six named clauses, set
  hash) or `bls_checkpoint::verify_checkpoint` — and what
  `Chain::finalized_height()` reports after activation.

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — L1 production | DONE |
| 2 — TaskContract + L2 txs | DONE |
| 3 — Dispute engine + M2/M1 | DONE |
| 4 — Verified Work Certificates | DONE |
| 5 — Worker SDK | DONE |
| 6 — Testnet + finality activation | **IN PROGRESS** — D6–D9 shipped: L2 transactions in L1 blocks, genesis escrow funding, the REST service API, and the fixed genesis committee. Binding finality is live on `testnet` (`finality_activation_height = 20`); `mini` keeps `0` (observation only) and `mainnet` activates at `100` with its 21-key public bootstrap committee (Decision 27). Deposits (§19.5) and the exits of §19.6 have since shipped too |

# Implementation status — Phase 6 M3 STEP 0 audit: deposits need a decision (2026-10-07)

The M3 audit (no code changed) confirmed Decision 7 does **not** authorise user
deposits: it calls the deposit/exit mechanism "a new L1 mechanism" that "is not
authorised by this decision". The audit's recommended mechanism is Option A, a
burn-to-sink overlay needing no L1 rule change and no new transaction type. The
seven parameters below are the missing decision. They are recorded here before
any M3 code, per the M3 instruction to stop until the decision is explicit.

## Decision 10 — User L1 → L2 deposits via burn-to-sink overlay

**Chosen: an ordinary STANDARD L1 payment to a params-derived unspendable sink
is interpreted by L2 replay as a deposit. No new L1 transaction type; existing
L1 machinery is unchanged.**

1. **Sink derivation.** `SHA256("srct/l2-deposit-sink/v1" ‖ network_id)[..20]`
   (`NetworkParams::l2_deposit_sink`). Deterministic per profile, distinct from
   the escrow identity (different domain tag), holding no key. A different
   network's sink on this chain is an ordinary burn, never a deposit.
2. **Recipient derivation.** The common owner of the transaction's inputs, each
   read as its input key bundle's address. L1 consensus already proves that
   address equals the spent UTXO's owner (`verify_input` refuses anything
   else), so replay derives ownership without re-verifying signatures and
   without UTXO history. Inputs with different owners, and coinbase
   transactions (unsigned inputs), are **not deposits**: the value stays burned
   and nothing is credited. No third-party recipient field exists in M3.
3. **Minimum deposit amount.** 1,000,000 sat (0.01 SRCT) per sink output, both
   profiles (`NetworkParams::l2_deposit_minimum_sat`). Below-minimum sink
   outputs are burns without credit. Rationale: 50× the largest D3 fee, a
   dust/bloat floor — every credited deposit leaves permanent unspendable UTXO
   entries, so crediting dust would let anyone bloat both ledgers for free.
4. **Maturity rule.** A deposit is *detected* when its block is accepted but
   *credited* (spendable) only once the carrying block is final by the
   existing depth rule: `tip_height − deposit_height ≥ finality_depth`
   (20 on `mini`, 100 on `mainnet`). No new finality mechanism is introduced;
   the rule reuses the finality depth every node already enforces. Before
   maturity the deposit is pending (visible, not spendable); a reorg that
   removes the block removes the deposit by re-derivation.
5. **Replay identity.** `(txid, output_index)` of the sink output, tracked in a
   consumed set in `L2State`. The same bytes in two blocks credit once; the
   second occurrence is refused by name. Restart and reorg re-derive the set
   from the winning chain, so no persisted record can go stale or duplicate.
6. **Conservation rule.** Per deposit, exactly 1:1 — credited satoshis equal
   the sink output's satoshis, no rate, no fee on the credit itself. Globally,
   `L1 live supply + L2 held − sink-held supply ≤ cumulative_issuance_sat(height)
   + escrow_ceiling_sat` (the bound Decision 18 left once the stock cap was
   deleted): sink outputs stay in the L1 UTXO set (unspendable by signature), so
   the joint check grows a sink term rather than breaking. Burns anywhere move
   the sum down, never up.
7. **Reorg behavior.** Derived, never undone: the winning chain is replayed and
   deposits are re-detected, re-matured and re-credited from it. A deposit on
   the losing branch vanishes; one still present but no longer deep enough
   returns to pending; one the winner shares is credited exactly once. No
   phantom, double, or stale credit is representable.

**Explicitly unchanged:** L1 consensus rules, the two L1 transaction types and
their layouts, issuance, fee rules, L2 transaction semantics, the M2 genesis
allocation, finality activation. (The "monetary cap" this clause once named was
deleted by Decision 18.)

**Superseded by Decision 19 (2026-10-09):** this decision's deferral of L2→L1
exits. The exit decision is now recorded and implemented (SPEC.md §19.6).
Deposits are no longer one-way wherever `exit_activation_height > 0`; on
`mainnet`, where it is `0` — meaning *never* — deposits stay closed **by
configuration**, which is a launch choice rather than a missing protocol.

# Implementation status — Phase 6 M4 STEP 0 audit: foundation without activation

The M4 audit (no code changed) re-examined the tree after M3 against STEPS
1–3 and found: no stake ledger, no bond/unbond path, no committee in params,
two checkpoint validators with no declared canonical one, no checkpoint codec
at all (serialize only), no finality wire message, and `Chain` consulting none
of it. The Decision 2 economics (any positive bond accepted, TopN 21, no rewards, no fee
share, full-bond equivocation burn) therefore have no mechanism to run on —
which is exactly what Decision 8 scoped out of Phase 6 ("no stake transaction
type, no bonded-stake ledger, and no unbonding are built in Phase 6", with no
minimum bond amount). That scoping is honored, not
re-designed: the items below build only what Decisions 2 (bootstrap mode) and
8 authorized, and binding finality is explicitly NOT activated. If a future
milestone wants binding finality, it needs its own decision.

## Decision 11 — Validator set + finality foundation (non-binding)

**Chosen: fixed genesis committee in `NetworkParams`, the six-clause
validator as the single checkpoint authority, relay-only checkpoint transport,
observation without activation.**

1. **Economics (STEP 2 verdict).** The implementation does not support bonded
   stake — no stake fields, no bond ledger, no reward or slash-bond path — and
   M4 adds none of them. Unchanged and still standing: no minimum bond amount,
   TopN 21 (reused as the committee-size cap), no validator rewards, no fee
   share, no issuance from validators, full-bond equivocation burn, L2 dispute
   slashing untouched. Bonding, unbonding, rewards and bond-slashing arrive
   with the stake ledger, which is mainnet-gated. Equivocation in M4 is
   detected and evidenced, not economically punished.
2. **Set derivation (STEP 3 answers).** (1) Stake lives nowhere in Phase 6.
   (2–3) No bonding/unbonding exists. (4) N/A. (5) Committee size is capped at
   21, fixed per profile, not selected. (6) No ties: the committee is an
   explicit key list, canonically sorted by key bytes. (7) Active from genesis,
   no rotation in M4. (8) The committee is explicit BLS keys in
   `NetworkParams` (`mini`: four deterministic test keys; `mainnet`: empty at
   the time, meaning no committee yet — Decision 27 later added 21 bootstrap
   keys). (9) Every node derives the identical `EpochSet` (epoch 0,
   set-hash bound) as a pure function of params.
3. **Canonical authority (STEP 5 verdict).** `validators::
   validate_checkpoint_against_set` (six clauses: epoch, set, bitmap, count,
   quorum, signature, monotonicity) is the single authority.
   `bls_checkpoint::verify_checkpoint` remains as its inner signature
   primitive, not a rival authority. `CheckpointChain` is the monotonic
   observation log. The payload gains no set-hash field in M4: with no
   rotation the epoch already scopes every certificate, and payload format
   changes wait until rotation needs them.
4. **Transport (STEP 6 verdict).** One relay-only message, `msg_type = 11
   CHECKPOINT`, carrying complete certificates only — no proposal/vote
   messages, because no BFT round protocol exists to give them meaning, and no
   aggregator protocol is built in M4 (test certificates are assembled from
   test keys). Received certificates are verified against the committee and
   relayed if valid; consensus never consults them. Protocol version stays 1:
   the §13.5 freeze rule already covers additive types.
5. **Non-binding gate (STEP 14).** `Chain::submit`, fork choice and
   `finalized_height` are untouched. Observed finality is reported
   (`status`/`verify`) and relayed, never enforced: a reorg crossing an
   observed checkpoint still applies, and that behavior is pinned by test so
   binding can never slip in silently. Binding finality requires a future,
   separately reviewed decision.
6. **L2 separation (STEP 10 verdict).** No L2 change. L2 `Settle` quorums
   belong to the task-arbitration domain, not the L1 checkpoint committee;
   conflating them would authorize settlements with checkpoint keys.
   `NodeL2` keeps the empty set, deposit maturity keeps `finality_depth`, and
   replay is untouched.
7. **Testnet profile (STEP 11 verdict).** No new `NetworkParams` profile in
   M4 (that is M5's P1 proposal). `mini` carries the test committee and a
   10-block checkpoint interval; `mainnet` carried an empty committee and a
   100-block interval until Decision 27. No public testnet starts in M4.

---

# Implementation status — Phase 6 M5 STEP 0 audit: binding finality needs four decisions

The M5 audit (no code changed) re-read the tree after M4 and found: L1 finality
is still depth-only (`Chain::finalized_height()` = `tip − finality_depth`), the
`FinalityManager` is observation-only and consulted by nothing, there is no
testnet profile, `equivocation_evidence` has no caller, L2 deposits mature by
depth only, and the node's L2 validator set is empty (fail-closed). Four
decisions are required before any consensus change: binding finality activation
(A), a testnet profile (B), equivocation detection policy (D), and L2 finality
semantics (E). This milestone records those four and implements exactly them.

## Decision 12 — Binding finality activation (A)

**Chosen: a valid checkpoint certificate over the active committee becomes
binding once the configured activation height is reached; `Chain::adopt()`
refuses to rewrite finalized history; the depth rule remains the fallback.**

The finalized checkpoint must be the canonical block at its height, carry a
valid certificate, satisfy `ceil(n × 6667 / 10000)` quorum (unchanged — no
stake-weighted quorum is invented), be strictly monotonic in height, and not
conflict with an already-finalized height. Once height H is finalized,
`Chain::adopt()` rejects any competing branch whose fork point is at or below
H (the existing `ReorgWouldCrossFinality` error, now fed by a real finalized
height). Before `activation_height`, only the depth rule applies and an
observed certificate is never binding.

## Decision 13 — Testnet profile (B)

**Chosen: a dedicated `testnet` profile — unique `network_magic`/`network_id`,
four deterministic genesis validators (quorum 3), a 10-block checkpoint
interval, and an explicit activation height. No staking, no rotation, no public
launch.**

The committee is a fixed genesis list derived from public test seeds, built by
the same derivation as `mini`, so two independently constructed `testnet`
profiles are byte-identical. This is the network config required to exercise
binding finality, not a public deployment.

## Decision 14 — Equivocation detection, no economic punishment (D)

**Chosen: retain deterministic `EquivocationEvidence` for conflicting valid
certificates; never finalize two different hashes at one height; fail closed on
the conflicting transition. Economic slashing stays deferred (no stake exists).**

When two otherwise-valid certificates disagree at the same height
(`H → A` and `H → B`), the second finalization transition is refused, the
conflict is detected, and canonical, bounded evidence is retained. Nothing is
burned and no penalty is invented, because there is no bond to burn.

## Decision 15 — L2 finality semantics (E)

**Chosen: deposit maturity requires BOTH depth and binding checkpoint finality
(take the stronger/safer); L2 settlement verifies against the declared active
committee, not the checkpoint-signing keys by convenience.**

Before binding finality activates, the M3 depth rule still governs, so M3 is
never made less safe. After activation, a deposit is not spendable merely
because depth is satisfied if the canonical history at that height is not
finalized. L2 does not grow a second finality system. `Settle`/VWC keep their
existing verification semantics but use the declared committee. Decision 27
later split this into `l2_settlement_validators`; mainnet keeps that set empty
and continues to fail closed.

---

# Implementation status — integrated sprint 1 (2026-10-07): machine/agent layer shipped

## Decision 16 — Machine/agent identity + authorization policy (roadmap items 3, 4, 6, 10)

**Chosen: a deterministic, non-consensus policy library, `crates/srct-core/src/agent.rs`.
No consensus rule changes; until a later decision wires it into `submit_at`, it
cannot move a coin.**

1. **Identity is derived, never assigned.**
   `agent_id = SHA256("srct/agent-id/v1" ‖ network_id ‖ role ‖ owner)[..20]`,
   where `owner` is an ordinary §1 address derived from the owner's key bundle.
   The identity is therefore cryptographically owned (only the key holder can
   produce `owner`), network-bound (a testnet identity is not a mini identity)
   and role-separated (`Human`, `Machine`, `Service`) without creating a second
   address space. `SpendPolicy::validate` *re-derives* it and refuses a policy
   whose `agent_id` does not belong to its `owner`, so a policy cannot claim
   someone else's agent (`PolicyError::IdentityMismatch`).
2. **One economy.** Machine and human wallets both spend ordinary §1 UTXOs under
   the existing issuance schedule. No second currency, no second ledger, no
   parallel monetary base (roadmap item 18).
3. **Policy is owner-signed and total.** `SpendPolicy::signing_hash` is
   domain-separated (`srct/agent-policy/v1`) over a bounded canonical
   encoding: version `1`, network id ≤ 64 bytes, ≤ 64 recipients, ≤ 64 service
   tags, explicit per-transaction limit, tumbling window length, cumulative
   limit, validity range, and a revoke flag. The test suite mutates **every**
   field and asserts the hash changes, so no field is outside the signature.
4. **Fail-closed default.** An **empty** recipient list authorizes nothing (not
   "anything"); an **empty** service list authorizes no service-tagged payment;
   a policy that names services refuses an untagged payment. Zero amounts,
   zero window, zero per-transaction limit, and `expires_at <= not_before` are
   refused at `validate`, before any authorization is attempted.
5. **Tumbling window, not sliding.** The cumulative limit resets every
   `window_blocks` measured from the window's own start height, so accounting is
   reproducible from `(window_start_height, height)` alone and needs no
   unbounded authorization history (a sliding window would be a
   resource-exhaustion surface). "Many small payments" therefore cannot bypass
   the per-transaction limit: the suite drives 400+400 and shows the third 400
   refused at 1 200 > 1 000 with the budget untouched by the refusal.
6. **Anti-replay.** Each authorization carries a nonce that must **strictly
   increase**, so a captured authorization cannot be re-submitted.
7. **Rotation and revocation.** Spend accounting is keyed by policy hash, not by
   agent id: a rotated-in policy starts with a fresh window and cannot inherit
   the old policy's spend, and a rotated-out policy is refused by the owner's
   `revoked` flag. `PolicyBook` is bounded (`DEFAULT_MAX_POLICIES`) and refuses
   a new policy rather than grow without limit.
8. **Offline verification.** `Authorization` has its own domain-separated
   signing hash (`srct/agent-auth/v1`) and `verify_authorization` checks it
   against public key bundles through the existing §1 signature path
   (`sig::verify_bundle`). A third party — a service, a bridge — verifies with
   public material only: no policy, no network, no private key. Mutating the
   amount breaks verification, so the authorization is tamper-evident.
9. **No key material.** Nothing in the module reads, stores or emits a private
   key; `SpendPolicy` discloses rules, never keys.

**Explicitly unchanged:** L1 consensus, transaction/block layout, UTXO and
supply rules, fee rules, finality activation, L2 semantics, the M1–M5
mechanisms. SPEC.md gains no section for this layer because SPEC's scope is the
base-layer consensus rules; the layer is tracked in `docs/roadmap.md` §21–§22.

**Explicitly deferred:** (a) enforcing a policy inside L1/L2 transaction
validation (that would be a consensus change and needs its own decision);
(b) the canonical agent service-payment format (item 11); (c) service receipts
(item 12); (d) bridge and reputation layers. The `Authorization` type is the
seam they will build on.

**Follow-up, no new decision:** streaming micro-payments
(`crates/srct-core/src/stream.rs`, roadmap item 30) build on this layer's seam
without changing it — a payer-signed `PaymentStream` plus payer-signed
`StreamSettlement` receipts against a fail-closed `StreamBook`, settled
through the ordinary payment path. No consensus rule is touched, so no
decision was needed; it is tracked in `docs/roadmap.md` §21 (item 30).

# Pending protocol decisions

These are the questions a protocol owner must answer **before** the
corresponding work may proceed. They are listed so implementation never has to
guess, and so no future reader mistakes their absence for an oversight.
`SPEC.md`, the code and the monetary policy remain the authority for what *is*
decided.

> **P1 is closed.** It was approved on 2026-10-09 and implemented the same day
> as **Decision 19** (see below). It is kept here because its design and its
> six answered questions are still the clearest statement of *why* the exit rule
> is shaped the way it is. **Do not read this section as an open blocker.**
> `P2`–`P5` below are the live ones.

## P1 — L2 → L1 exit primitive — RESOLVED: Decision 19 (approved, implemented)

**Status: APPROVED 2026-10-09, IMPLEMENTED the same day.** E-1 = (a), E-2 =
permissionless crank, E-3 = exiting owner prepays the exit fee, as recommended;
E-4–E-6 at their narrow defaults. See **Decision 19** below for the
implementation record and `SPEC.md §19.6` for the normative text.

Decision 10 originally deferred exits and stated that no exit decision was
recorded. The deposit sink holds no key, so it cannot release funds; an exit
therefore needs a **new L1 rule**. Decision 19 is that rule.

### The constraint was proven in code, then satisfied by a rule

`crates/srct-core/tests/sink_unspendable.rs` drives the real L1 spend rule
(`ledger::check_tx` → `tx.verify_input(k, &held.out.address, …)`) against a real
mined deposit and shows:

- the **depositor cannot reclaim its own sink output** (`Error::WrongAddress`) —
  the signature verifies against the depositor but is compared to the *sink*;
- a stranger's attempt fails identically, and an unsigned attempt fails one step
  earlier (`Error::EmptySignatureBundle`);
- the sink and escrow identities are distinct, derived, and owned by no wallet.

That test **still passes unchanged**, and it must: the conclusion it pins is
about *signatures*. **No signature can authorise a sink spend, and no L2 state
can change that.** What changed is that a release no longer needs one — it is
authorised by an inclusion proof against a committed `l2_state_root`, so the
sink's keylessness is no longer the obstacle. The sink was deliberately **not**
replaced by a validator-threshold escrow (E-1 option (b) rejected).

### The six questions, as answered by Decision 19

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| **E-1** | The L1 release primitive | **(a)** a consensus-authorised **spend of sink outputs**, authorised by an exit proof instead of a signature. Chosen because it keeps the ordinary `value_in >= value_out` rule in force everywhere and reuses the existing `Undo` path, so a reorg unwinds a release like any other spend. |
| **E-2** | Permitless crank or gated release | **Permissionless crank.** Anyone may submit; consensus pays only the recorded `destination` and `claimant`. No operator privilege, no second authorisation path to audit. |
| **E-3** | Who funds the L1 release fee | **The exiting owner, prepaid at queue time.** The L2 side debits `amount + exit_fee + queue_fee`; the claimant receives `exit_fee_sat`, the destination receives `amount`. Prepayment is what makes the crank griefing-bounded. |
| **E-4** | Cancellable queued state | **No cancellation** — the narrower default. A cancel/claim race needs its own ordering rule for no benefit; the value is encumbered for exactly one finality window. |
| **E-5** | Challenge window | **None in v1** — the narrower default. An exit is a pure function of final L1 state, and finality already supplies the guarantee. |
| **E-6** | Emergency pause | **Not authorised in v1** — the narrower default. It concentrates trust in a governance key the architecture does not have. |

### Engineering scope — all shipped

- **The L2 → L1 proof mechanism.** Implemented exactly as recommended: a block
  commits `l2_state_root`, and a claim carries a Merkle inclusion proof of its
  exit record against it. `ChainL2` captures an `ExitWatch` (record plus proof)
  at the queue block — the only moment the node's root equals the block's
  committed root — so a crank never replays back to `queued_height`.
- **An activation mechanism.** There is still **no negotiated network-upgrade
  mechanism**. `finality_activation_height`, `exit_activation_height` and the
  Decision 18 `tail_activation_height` are height-gated **profile data**, not
  negotiated upgrades. That remains an open prerequisite for changing any of
  them on a live chain.

### What is already implemented

**Proof half:** `crates/srct-core/src/state_root.rs` builds and verifies account
inclusion proofs (`account_leaf`, `state_root`, `prove_inclusion`,
`verify_inclusion`), exposed over real L2 state by `L2State::{state_root,
account_proof, verify_account}`, `exit_proof` and
`crates/srct-l2/tests/state_root_proof.rs`.

**Release half (Decision 19):** `crates/srct-core/src/exit.rs` (claim codec,
identity, gas, proof verification), `Chain::{check_claim, apply_one_claim,
exit_active_at, exit_released, mine_from_pool_with_exits}`, `L2State::{queue_exit,
exit_is_mature, note_release, exited_total}`, `ChainL2::{pending_exits,
ExitWatch}`, `NodeL2::{crank_claims, simulate_root}`,
`crates/srct-worker/src/exit.rs`, and the tests
`crates/srct-l2/tests/{exit_flow,exit_claim}.rs`,
`crates/srct-node/tests/exit_crank.rs`.

### The migration checklist, as executed

`crates/srct-core/tests/sink_unspendable.rs` was **kept** — its claim is about
signatures, which still cannot spend a sink output. `crates/srct-l2/tests/
exit_unavailable.rs` (the "exactly five type bytes" assertion) was **deleted**
and replaced by `exit_flow.rs` / `exit_claim.rs`. `crates/srct-node/tests/
conservation.rs` passes **unchanged**, which is the strongest available evidence
the accounting was right: the joint check needed no exit term at all, because the
L1 payment and the L2 debit cancel while the sink term falls by the same amount.

## Decision 17 — Conservation-breach response: freeze funding paths, alarm (2026-10-09)

Owner-approved companion to the live conservation surface (`GET
/v1/conservation`, the `/metrics` gauges, and the `srct-worker run` gate).
When a node detects that the joint-supply bound is broken (L2 not closed, L2
funding anomaly, or joint supply over its bound), it must:

1. **Refuse the funding-shaped paths** — L2 include-queue admission and the
   deposit/L2 write endpoints stop being accepted, with an error naming
   conservation, so the node stops making a bad situation worse;
2. **Keep serving reads** — `/v1/status`, `/v1/conservation`, `/metrics`,
   blocks and UTXO queries stay up, so operators can see what happened;
3. **Log the breach loudly** on every serve iteration while it persists.Halt (process exit) was rejected: a crash-loop converts a safety alarm into a
liveness loss and destroys the diagnostics. Alarm-only was rejected as
insufficient once detection is this cheap. Recovery is an operator action —
restart after the cause is understood; the check re-runs on every request
and no state is discarded.

**Implemented 2026-10-09.** The refusal half is
`api::refuse_funding_if_breached`: `/v1/l2/broadcast` is refused *before the
payload is decoded* (the path is refused, not the request), and
`/v1/tx/broadcast` only when the payment actually carries a sink output — a
blanket L1 freeze was rejected because it would stop the chain without fixing
the number, so an ordinary payment and a payment to the escrow identity still
relay. Both refuse with `503 conservation_breach`, name the broken check, and
point at `GET /v1/conservation`, which goes on serving the broken verdict
(`ok: false`). The alarm half is the serve loop's repeating `CONSERVATION
BREACH` line, rate-limited to once a second rather than literally every
iteration because the loop spins with `--interval-ms 0` and a whole-UTXO scan
per spin would stall a breached node; it reprints every second for as long as
the breach lasts, so it cannot pass silently, and prints a clearing line when
the condition goes away. Nothing is cached or discarded. Pinned by
`crates/srct-node/tests/breach_response.rs` (4 tests through real HTTP with a
real signed deposit) and the pre-existing `api`/`conservation_api` suites.

## P2 — Bonded stake / mainnet validator committee (mainnet blocker)

Decision 2 fixes the economics (no minimum stake — any positive bond accepted; bonded,
unbonding after `finality_depth`; TopN 21; no rewards; no fee share;
full-bond equivocation burn) and Decision 8 deliberately builds **none** of the
mechanism — no stake transaction, no bond ledger, no unbonding. Consequences
that remain unbuilt:

1. A **stake/bond transaction type** and its validation rules (new L1 rule).
2. A **bonded-stake ledger** and the selection rule that reads it ("TopN by
   stake at the seed block" is currently a pure function over the genesis list).
3. **Unbonding** after a full finality window, and the interaction with the
   checkpoint-signing duty.
4. **Validator rewards / fee share** — deliberately *none* today (Decision 2
   item 3). Adding any is a monetary decision and is explicitly out of scope.
5. **Equivocation slashing** — evidence exists (`EquivocationEvidence`) but no
   bond exists to burn, so punishment is deferred.
6. **A mainnet committee.** `NetworkParams::mainnet()` originally carried an
   **empty** `genesis_validators`; Decision 27 resolved this with a 21-key
   public bootstrap committee active at height 100.

None of 1–6 may be invented by implementation; each needs a recorded decision.

> **Update 2026-10-10 (Decision 20, implemented):** items 1 (stake/bond
> validation rules), 2 (bond ledger + TopN selection), 3 (unbonding after a
> full finality window), 5 (full-bond equivocation burn via `TX_SLASH`) and 6
> (21-key bootstrap via Decision 27) are built; item 4 stays deliberately
> *none* (no rewards, no fee share). The mechanism has since been hardened
> further: seed-height committee snapshots with reorg rollback, per-epoch
> slash verification, fail-closed committees, and one-epoch-grace set expiry
> (2026-10-28 fixes).

## P3 — M2 activation rule (mainnet blocker)

The anti-collusion slash vault exists (`slash.rs`) but **no rule triggers it**.
What must be decided: what *proves* a compute result fraudulent well enough to
slash, and how that verdict enters consensus. Unspecified → M2 stays inactive.

## P4 — M4 registration (mainnet blocker)

The HBM scratchpad puzzle (`hbm_pow.rs`) is registered in code as
`puzzle_id = 2` (`PuzzleSpec::hbm_v1`), but it is **not the active mining
puzzle on any profile**. What must still be decided: whether M4 *replaces* or
*composes with* the §5 puzzle at activation, and the governance rule for
flipping it. Until then chain security rests on §5 only.

## P5 — Open interaction carried from Phase 2/3 (economic)

A task whose L2 escrow or worker deposit is smaller than the **20,000 sat
settle fee** cannot be settled (`AmountTooSmallForFee` fails closed). Carried
forward since Phase 2. What must be decided: whether the settle fee is drawn
from elsewhere or the D3 schedule is re-parameterised. Until then, small tasks
fail closed rather than collecting a partial fee — the safe direction.

## P6 — Mainnet L2 genesis escrow scale (not a blocker, a confirmation)

Decision 7 sets `mainnet` `l2_genesis_escrow_sat = 100,000 SRCT`, bounded by the
explicit `escrow_ceiling_sat` that `NetworkParams::validate` checks (approved
M-E) — currently set tight to the allocation. If the protocol owner intends a
different scale, that is a one-value change.

(The original wording justified this as a slice of "the 788,476 SRCT that can
never be minted". That figure died with the stock cap in Decision 18: with a tail
there is no fixed quantity that can never be minted, so the ceiling is now the
`escrow_ceiling_sat` parameter alone.)

# Monetary decisions M-A…M-E — all APPROVED and IMPLEMENTED (2026-10-09)

`docs/monetary-redesign.md` is the analysis and sensitivity record; this
section is the *sign-off surface* it was resolved on. Every item below was
approved on 2026-10-09 and shipped the same day, so nothing here is open. The
frozen state in Decisions 7 and 10 stood **while** they were open; what changed
under them is the tail (M-A…M-C), the escrow ceiling (M-E) and — via
**Decision 18** — the deletion of the stock cap (M-D, superseded the same day).

State before Decision 18 (historical, kept so the arithmetic can be checked):
stock cap **39,945,600 SRCT**; ladder-era issuance **39,157,124 SRCT** (the earlier
39,157,200 was the geometric shortcut `149 × 262 800`, which over-states the
schedule by 76 SRCT because genesis occupies a rung-0 height without minting);
**788,476 SRCT** of that cap permanently unmintable; ladder
`76, 38, 19, 9, 4, 2, 1` in whole SRCT; `halving_period` 262,800; ladder exhausts
at height **1,839,600**.

**After Decision 18 there is no cap and no unmintable figure.** 39,157,124 SRCT is
simply what the ladder *pays out*; the rate anchor (≤ 1 % of issued supply per
post-ladder window) is the only ceiling, and the tail then issues forever.

| # | Question | Options | Consequence if changed | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **M-A** | Tail emission shape at ladder exhaustion | **(A)** retain zero tail · **(D)** flat tail · **(E)** declining tail to a floor | Any tail **requires a supply-rule change** and a new issuance anchor; `cap − max_issuance_sat` can no longer be the escrow backing rule (see M-D/M-E) | **APPROVED — (E) decay tail** |
| **M-B** | Tail floor value | proposed **0.1 SRCT/block** · 1.00 · 0.50 · other | Sets steady-state dilution (0.10 SRCT ≈ 0.0134 %/yr); the proposal derives this from a security-floor argument, **not** from any repository constant | **APPROVED — 0.1 SRCT/block mainnet floor** |
| **M-C** | Per-network tail | mainnet value · testnet/mini value (proposed **1 sat/block**) | Applying the mainnet value to mini would mint **>1,000 %/yr** (proposal F5); the two profiles must be set independently | **APPROVED — 1 sat/block on mini/testnet** |
| **M-D** | Fate of `supply_cap_sat` | **keep** as a sanity ceiling · **replace** with an explicit invariant | `supply_cap_sat` is currently the *joint L1/L2 conservation anchor* **and** the escrow backing rule, not just a ceiling. Deleting it without a replacement silently removes both checks. The proposal rejects deletion-for-convenience | **APPROVED — cap retained; SUPERSEDED the same day by [Decision 18](#decision-18--supply-anchor-a-rate-rule-replaces-the-stock-cap-approved-and-implemented-2026-10-09), which deleted `supply_cap_sat` entirely and replaced it with the rate anchor** |
| **M-E** | Meaning of `escrow_ceiling` | define an explicit, validated parameter · keep the implicit `cap − max_issuance_sat` gap | No `escrow_ceiling` symbol exists in code or SPEC today. It is the proposal's replacement for the gap rule once a tail changes issuance. Ownership, release rules, reorg behaviour and interaction with spendable supply are **all unspecified** | **APPROVED — explicit validated `escrow_ceiling` parameter** |
| **M-F** | Fee-burn / deflation design (proposal F2) | own the design (set an explicit target or accept deflation) · leave unowned and state no target | Under ordinary usage the **whole** base fee leaves live supply (50 % burned + 50 % to the `pscb_reserve` counter, which no code path converts back to UTXOs — verified 2026-10-09). At high activity live supply trends to zero at ~y50 in the proposal's model. This is **not** an issuance question, but it blocks any claim that monetary policy is "complete" | **APPROVED — no numeric target; deflation accepted and documented** |
| **M-G** | Activation mechanism | network-upgrade flag/height · historical-compatibility expectation · vector changes | Proposal §5.4 argues activation at exhaustion (1,839,600) leaves existing history byte-identical. **No mainnet activation until M-A…M-F are approved**; vector changes are only legitimate once an approved rule actually changes consensus | **APPROVED — activation at each profile's ladder exhaustion (mainnet 1,839,600; mini/testnet 14,000)** |

**Approved 2026-10-09 (owner), item by item:** M-A = (E) decay tail; M-B =
0.1 SRCT/block mainnet floor; M-C = 1 sat/block on mini/testnet; M-D =
`supply_cap_sat` retained as a sanity ceiling only — **superseded the same day
by Decision 18, which deleted the field and `Error::SupplyCapExceeded` and put
the rate anchor in their place**; M-E = an explicit validated `escrow_ceiling`
parameter; M-F = no numeric burn target — deflation accepted and documented;
M-G = activation at each profile's ladder exhaustion. Implementation is
authorised **only** along these lines; any other value needs a new record here.

**Historical constraint, lifted.** While M-A…M-G were open, only auditing, tests,
simulation and documentation describing current behaviour was allowed; editing
`params.rs` reward/cap/escrow values, `supply.rs`, the consensus cap gate, or committed
vectors was not. Once approved, that work was done under these decisions and under
Decision 18 — the implementation record below says exactly what changed, and no
frozen vector moved.

## Implementation record — approved 2026-10-09 (M1…M5, complete)

`docs/monetary-redesign.md` §6 is the acceptance matrix; every row below is
verified, not asserted.

| Milestone | Delivered |
|---|---|
| **M1 (decision recorded)** | M-A…M-G recorded above; Decisions 7/10 amended for issuance and the escrow rule only. Commit `e3a5713`. |
| **M2 (model)** | `sim/supply_schedule_sim.py` exits 0 and regenerated `tests/vectors/supply_vectors.json`; `sim/tail_emission_sim.py --selftest` exits 0; `sim/verify_vectors.py` exits 0. The two sims and `supply.rs` agree to the satoshi, including the period-boundary off-by-one that both previously carried and the exact ladder-era total (39,157,124.5 SRCT at the first tail block). |
| **M3 (consensus)** | `supply::check_mint_at_height` is the single mint gate and `Chain::apply_block` calls it; `params::validate` refuses a zero tail floor/constant and an escrow above its ceiling; §6.1 tests 1–14 exist (`historical_replay_is_unchanged_by_the_tail` = `historical_heights_keep_their_ladder_rungs_under_the_tail`, `reward_step_at_the_ladder_tail_boundary_is_at_most_a_halving` = `every_tail_step_is_at_most_a_halving_and_reaches_the_floor`); `cargo test --workspace` 0 failures; clippy `-D warnings` clean; fmt clean. |
| **M4 (spec/docs)** | SPEC §7 and §19.4, this file, `docs/monetary-policy.md`, `docs/mainnet-readiness.md` and `README.md` re-stated to the shipped function; no document still claims a frozen zero tail or the `cap − max_issuance_sat` backing rule. |
| **M5 (ops)** | Vectors frozen in git; `srct-node verify` and `/v1/conservation` report the joint bound; `srct-worker run` gates on it (older nodes fall back to the sanity cap, i.e. a stricter check). |

Milestones **not** claimed here: M-F owns no numeric fee-burn target (deflation
accepted and documented in `monetary-policy.md`), and the exit rule (P1) remains
a separate, unimplemented mainnet blocker.

## Decision 18 — Supply anchor: a rate rule replaces the stock cap (APPROVED AND IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-09)

**Raised by the owner 2026-10-09:** should SRCT have a fixed numerical cap, no
cap, or a mechanism of a different kind, given the goal of a currency for AI,
robotics and humans that works at today's scale and at a Mars-scale one?

**Full analysis, numbers and migration plan: `docs/supply-anchor-decision.md`.**
The recommendation is that the stock cap is replaced by a **rate anchor** —
gross issuance after the ladder era may never exceed **1 % of issued supply per
`halving_period` (≤ 0.2 %/yr)** — with the permanent tail kept as the floor and
burns kept on the net side.

The decisive finding is that **the cap and the already-approved permanent tail
contradict each other**: with policy E, the cap binds at block **8,213,259**
(≈ **156.2 years**) and issuance then stops forever, so "permanent 0.1 SRCT
floor" really means 156 years. A rate anchor cannot be repealed that way: a
constant absolute trickle becomes *less* dilutive as supply grows (0.0132 %/yr
today, 0.0013 % at 10× supply), while a stock cap only grows more binding.

**Relation to the approved M-D.** M-D kept `supply_cap_sat` because it was then
"the joint L1/L2 conservation anchor **and** the escrow backing rule, not just
a ceiling". Both of those jobs have since been moved off it by the very
milestones shipped under M-D/M-E: the joint bound is now
`cumulative_issuance_sat(height) + escrow_ceiling_sat`, and the escrow is backed
by the explicit validated `escrow_ceiling_sat`. The cap is therefore *already*
all ceiling and nothing else, which is why replacing it is a deliberate
substitution rather than the deletion-for-convenience M-D rejected.

**Status: APPROVED 2026-10-09 (owner sign-off on the rate anchor).** The
M-A…M-G freeze ("no editing `params.rs` reward/cap/escrow values, `supply.rs`,
the consensus cap gate, or committed vectors") governs the *reward ladder, tail
values and fee schedules*, and those stay as approved. It is **lifted for the
supply anchor only**: the stock cap, the mint bound, and the new rate anchor are
now authorised for implementation along §4 of `supply-anchor-decision.md`.

**Implementation record — stages 2–5 complete (2026-10-09).** `supply_cap_sat`
is deleted from `NetworkParams` (all profiles), the deprecated
`Error::SupplyCapExceeded` variant is removed, and the mint bound is the
issuance integral alone. The rate anchor is enforced in
`supply::check_mint_at_height` (1 % of issued per post-ladder window; the ladder
era is grandfathered), pinned by
`supply::tests::rate_anchor_refuses_a_schedule_that_over_issues_a_window` and
the sim's rate-headroom section. `tests/vectors/supply_vectors.json` is
regenerated with the anchor fields (`rate_anchor_max_pct_per_period`,
`largest_tail_window_pct_of_issued` ≈ 0.34 % on mainnet). Net supply
(gross issuance minus burned + PSCB removal, both rewound on reorg) is reported
by `status`, `GET /v1/conservation` and the `/metrics` gauges. Touched suites
green (`srct-core` lib, `redteam`, node conservation/api/l2 suites, worker
http/cli), both sim selftests pass, `verify_vectors.py --check` passes,
clippy `-D warnings` and `fmt --check` clean.

**Compatibility note:** unlike the exit rule (P1), this change needs **no
activation height**. The mint bound only loosens (`min(integral, cap)` →
`integral`), so every historical block remains valid and replay stays
byte-identical.

---

## Decision 19 - L2 -> L1 exit rule (approved, implemented)

**Status: APPROVED and IMPLEMENTED.** Supersedes Decision 10's deferral of
exits and settles questions 1-3 of `docs/l2-exit-design.md`; questions 4-6 take
the recommendations recorded there (no cancellation, no challenge window, no
emergency pause in v1). Normative text: SPEC.md 19.6.

**1. The primitive.** A block carries `exit_claims`. A claim takes **sink
outputs** as inputs and is authorised by an *inclusion proof* against the
`l2_state_root` committed at the queue height - not by a signature, because the
sink holds no key. Consuming the sink rather than minting against it keeps the
ordinary `value_in >= value_out` rule in force everywhere and reuses the `Undo`
path, so a reorg unwinds a release exactly as it unwinds any spend. The rejected
alternative was minting against the sink as a permanent counterweight: it would
have made the release the protocol's only inflation-exception transaction type.

**2. Permissionless or gated.** **Permissionless.** Anyone may build and submit
a claim; consensus pays only the `destination` and `claimant` the proven L2 exit
record names. No operator privilege, no second authorisation path to audit.

**3. Who funds the L1 release fee.** **The exiting owner, prepaid at queue
time.** The L2 side debits `amount + exit_fee + queue_fee`; the claimant
receives `exit_fee_sat`, the destination receives `amount`. This is what makes
the crank griefing-bounded - a claim not worth submitting simply is not
submitted, and nobody can be forced to pay for it. An unfunded or
protocol-funded release is a spam surface and was not adopted.

**Activation.** `NetworkParams::exit_activation_height`, where `0` means
**never** rather than *from genesis*: a profile that has chosen no height accepts
neither a committed L2 root nor a claim (`Chain::exit_active_at`). At and after
activation an L2-bearing block must commit a root - an exit cannot be proven
without one, so a rootless block would silently disable exits.

**Maturity.** The stronger of the two Decision 15 rules: depth `finality_depth`
**and**, once binding finality is active, the binding checkpoint height. Exits
are never less safe than deposits.

**Exactly-once.** `(owner, nonce)` is the exit identity. Consensus keeps a
consumed-identity set, so a replayed release is refused by consensus rather than
by bookkeeping. A release is an ordinary undoable L1 operation: a reorg clears
the mark and L2 replay regenerates the watch, so a rolled-back exit is spendable
again and one the winner keeps is re-marked.

**Accounting.** L2 debit equals L1 release, 1:1, no rate and no fee on the
principal. The 19.5 joint check is **unchanged**: the L1 payment `+a` and the L2
debit `-a` cancel while the sink term falls by the same `a`, so `joint_sat`
needs no exit term. `tests/conservation.rs` passing untouched is the evidence.
`exited_sat` is reported so an operator can confirm both sides balanced.

**Implementation note.** `ChainL2` captures an `ExitWatch` (record plus
`InclusionProof`) at the queue block - the only moment the node's L2 root equals
the block's committed root. A crank never replays back to `queued_height`, which
the design had rejected as unviable as a consensus rule.

# Launch decisions (approved 2026-10-10, implementation follows)

## Launch principle — no post-launch governance

No governance-controlled parameter and no administrator override exist after
launch. Every value below is an immutable consensus constant, not a tunable.
Any future consensus change ships as a new software version adopted voluntarily
by independent node operators — never by the control of a person or committee.
(Operational corollary, owner's side not consensus: bootnodes are 3–5
independently operated, geographically distributed VPS nodes, with their
addresses published in open-source configuration.)

## Decision 20 — Bonded stake + mainnet committee (P2)

**Status: APPROVED 2026-10-10, IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-10, REVISED 2026-10-17.** Resolves P2's design;
the mechanism follows as a new L1 rule. Decision 2's economics stand (TopN 21,
no rewards, no fee share); this decision supplies what Decision 8 deliberately
left unbuilt.

1. **No minimum stake; anti-dust floor instead (AMENDED 2026-10-30, exit throttle added 2026-10-30).** Any
   positive bond amount is accepted into the bond ledger. The 5,000 SRCT
   minimum stake from the original Decision 2 design has been **removed**:
   Solar Cyber Unit is permissionless. The committee is stake-weighted
   (TopN by stake), so smaller bonds simply rank lower and fail to make the top
   21. What the amendment adds is a dust floor, not a stake threshold:
   `NetworkParams::min_bond_sat` (0 on `mini`/`testnet`, 1_000_000 sat on
   `mainnet`, the same anti-dust scale as `l2_deposit_minimum_sat`) — a bond
   below the floor is refused at admission and in blocks, because 1-sat bonds
   cost every node permanent ledger entries at only fee cost to the
   submitter. Permissionless means no wealth gate; it never meant free
   state bloat.
2. **Committee: stake-weighted TopN, capped at 21.** Eligibility = a valid
   bond of any positive amount, proof of possession included. The committee
   fills from the highest bond amounts, reproducibly from chain state alone.
   **Bond order is deliberately not part of the selection**: the earliest 21
   bonds holding seats forever would be both a permanent incumbency and the
   one property that could not be re-derived from stake. No genesis-fixed
   identities, no privileged or permanent founder seats.
3. **Unbonding: 7 days, fixed in the protocol rules** — 1008 blocks at the
   mainnet 10-minute block time — after a full finality window, keeping the
   checkpoint-signing duty until release.
4. **Equivocation: full-bond burn once a bond exists to burn.** The evidence
   (`EquivocationEvidence`, Decision 14) already exists; punishment was
   deferred only for lack of a bond. Adding validator rewards of any kind stays
   a monetary decision and out of scope (Decision 2 item 3 stands).
5. **A mainnet committee.** Resolved by Decision 27: mainnet carries 21 public
   deterministic bootstrap keys (quorum 15) and activates binding finality at
   height 100. The first bond replaces them with the stake-weighted TopN set.

**Status: APPROVED 2026-10-10, IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-10.** A compute result is
fraudulent if and only if deterministic CPU re-execution over the identical
inputs reproducibly mismatches the claimed output; the mismatch plus the
execution evidence constitutes the fraud proof.

**Implementation (2026-10-10).** One canonical reference function
(`compute_ir::reference_output`/`reference_result_hash`, SPEC §16.6) run by
worker, challenger and arbitrator alike — no height input, since
reproducibility demands identical inputs and a height is never identical
(worker `CpuExecutor` delegates; replay protection stays with expiry and
attestation heights). `DisputeEngine::resolve` computes the reference itself
from the disputed contract instead of taking a caller hash, so no party can
dictate the verdict it will be judged by. The quorum-signed verdict →
slash-record path is unchanged per SPEC §16.4 (no on-chain execution, no
interpreter). `dispute_flow.rs` now arbitrates real reference outputs
(worker-correct / challenger-correct / inconclusive worlds); fraud verdicts
write vault slash records exactly as before. Still operator infra, not built
here: the quorum coordination transport that carries verdicts to `Settle`
needs a key-custody decision first.

## Decision 22 — HBM as an additional commitment layer (P4, DRAFT)

**Status: DRAFT — explicitly NOT activated.** The header carries an HBM
commitment alongside the base §5 PoW, and both verifications are deterministic
under the consensus rules. The base puzzle is never silently replaced: HBM
composes with the established mechanism, it does not substitute for it.
Activation requires a written security analysis and benchmarks first; until
then chain security rests on §5 alone. Design shape recorded in
`docs/hbm-composition-draft.md` (2026-10-10): additional header commitment,
activation checklist, open questions — still no code, still not activated.

> **Update 2026-10-12 / 2026-10-28:** the code now exists — `hbm_pow.rs`
> verified and reviewed, registered as `puzzle_id = 2`, and `srct-miner` carries
> an HBM solver arm (`PowMode::Hbm`) — but activation is still **not** set on
> any profile, and the `production()` parameter defect plus the missing panic
> guard (`docs/security-review-hbm-2026-10-12.md` §§5–6) still block mainnet
> use.

## Decision 23 — Proportional settle fee (P5)

**Status: APPROVED 2026-10-10, IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-10.** The rigid 20,000-sat
floor (`AmountTooSmallForFee`) is replaced by a deterministic protocol rule:
**0.1% of task value, minimum 1,000 sat** as the anti-spam floor. No
discretionary fee changes, per the launch principle.

**Implementation (2026-10-10).** `settle_fee_sat` (`l2.rs`) computed from the
task's escrow at `apply_settle`; fraud charges it against the deposit with the
submitter still refunded whole. Worker estimators (`earnings_of`,
`net_payment_sat`, discovery filter) use the proportional fee. All pinned
20,000-sat expectations migrated; `tests/settle_fee.rs` stress suite covers
the dust boundary, 48 mixed-size tasks with exact 50/50 split accounting, and
the fraud-from-task-value path. SPEC §15.4 amended.

## Exit activation (recorded, FLIPPED)

Originally recorded as deliberately **not** set: mainnet exits were to stay
closed until the full L2→L1 withdrawal path was verified tested-and-safe.
That verification completed (exit-path audit below, plus the full loop,
refusals, unwinds and conservation suites), and the height has since flipped:
`mainnet.exit_activation_height = 1` — exits work from genesis, same as
Bitcoin spends. Per Decision 19 semantics, `0` means *never*, so `1` is the
earliest possible activation.

**Exit-path audit (2026-10-10).** `exit_crank.rs` grew three tests: a claim
block reorged away is re-cranked and settles again (identity unmarked,
conservation survives); a queue block reorged away drops the watch (no
phantom claim, even far past finality); two exits crank and settle together
exactly once each. The batch test caught a real crank bug (two claims funded
from the same sink output — the crank now retires assigned inputs per exit).
Full loop, refusals, unwinds and conservation remain green; on this evidence
alone the height was held, and flipped only after the complete withdrawal-path
verification above.

## Decision 24 — Post-quantum succession: BLS design + migration rule (RECORDED, partly implemented)

Steps 1 and 2 of the PQ plan are live (scheme 3 = ML-DSA-65 in the spend
bundle; 64-byte txid and block hash). Two halves remain, and they are not the
same kind of work: the BLS half is a design (no code yet), the migration half
is a small enforcement primitive plus a rule that stays off until it is
explicitly flipped.

### Step 3 — BLS succession (design only, no code)

Shor breaks BLS12-381 exactly as it breaks secp256k1, so the lattice half of a
spend bundle does not save anything BLS signs. Two surfaces:

- **Checkpoint certificates** (short-lived, per-epoch): a forged quorum moves
  binding finality and freezes honest history.
- **VWC `Quorum` certificates** (long-lived evidence): a forged aggregate
  manufactures "verified work" that never happened, and the forgery is
  checkable offline forever.

Options considered and rejected:

- **Swap BLS for ML-DSA multisig.** ML-DSA has no pairing-based aggregation,
  so a "quorum aggregate" becomes a list of 3 309-byte signatures. Certificate
  size explodes and every verifier changes shape. Rejected as a flag day.
- **SPHINCS+ (stateless hash-based).** No lattice assumptions at all, but
  signatures are 8–30 KB each — unrelayable inside the current checkpoint
  envelope. Rejected for the transport, kept in mind for cold, rarely-checked
  evidence.

**Chosen direction: dual-signature checkpoints.** BLS stays exactly where it
is (compatibility: old verifiers keep reading the BLS half), and an ML-DSA-65
sidecar carries the same decision under each signer's lattice key. A
checkpoint is binding only when *both* halves verify against the same
committee. VWC `Quorum` carries the settle sidecar, because settle quorums turned out to BE a registered committee: a settle is authorized by the validator-quorum aggregate, so every signer resolves to a bond-held lattice key through the epoch set — no separate arbitrator registry needed. Votes carry an optional lattice signature (keyed members only, decided by the bond ledger at signing time); the tally collects them; apply and VWC validation verify clause-7-shape. Pinned by tests/pq_settle.rs (5 tests: full chain plus strip/forge/missing-entry attacks at apply and at VWC time). No new curve, no trusted setup, and it reuses the scheme-3 key
material the staking path already knows how to hold.

Open wiring, stated up front: validators today hold BLS keys, not lattice
keys, so the sidecar needs a per-validator ML-DSA key registered beside the
bond — that registration is the code half of this decision and is **not**
built here. Nothing in this decision changes a runtime rule.

### Step 4 — Migration rule (primitive implemented, activation NOT set)

Moving funds to a PQ address is an ordinary spend (`classical_addr` →
`pq_address`): no new transaction type, no committee, no ceremony. What the
chain needs is the *deadline* that makes the move happen before a CRQC, not
after. That deadline has two parts:

1. **The enforcement primitive — implemented now.** `Transaction::verify_input_pq`
   verifies exactly like `verify_input` and additionally refuses any bundle
   that does not carry scheme 3. Structural check first (the scheme id is
   absent), cryptography never runs for a bundle that cannot satisfy the rule.
   Pinned by `tests/pq_migrate.rs` (3 tests).
2. **The activation — NOT set.** Flipping consensus to `verify_input_pq`
   happens through an explicit `pq_activation_height` change, `0` meaning
   *never* like every other activation in this codebase. That wiring (height
   plumbing through the check path, per-profile heights, a rehearsal on
   testnet first) is a separate, reviewable change and is not smuggled in
   here.

The honest tradeoff, in one sentence: after activation, classical-only outputs
do not move — they are frozen, not confiscated, and they stay in the UTXO set
where a later rule can only ever thaw them, never invent them. That is why
the grace period between announcing the height and flipping it must be long,
and why the flip waits for a testnet rehearsal like every other activation.

## Settle-vote age — analysed, no maximum needed

**Status: ANALYSED 2026-10-15, no change.**

A settle vote now binds network and height inside its signed hash, so an
aggregate over one chain's decision does not verify on another chain, and a
vote from the future is refused at apply. What is still absent is a maximum
vote *age*, so the question was asked directly: can an old aggregate change
state it was not intended to change?

`crates/srct-l2/tests/settle_stale_quorum.rs` tries the three shapes that
could matter, each against a real quorum aggregate over a disputed task:

1. **The same task and the same decision, again.** Identical bytes are
   `Replay` (a task settles once, so the txid is already applied). The same
   decision *signed afresh* at a later height produces a different payload
   and is refused by the state machine as `IllegalTransition` — the task is
   already settled. No second certificate, no value moved.
2. **The same decision pointed at another task.** The id is refused as
   `UnknownTask` when the state does not hold it, and `IllegalTransition`
   when it holds a task that was never disputed. A vote's referent is
   `task_id`, which is derived from the post payload, so there is no way to
   name another task without naming another task.
3. **The same task after its state machine moved on.** Applied after the
   dispute window lapsed, the explicit settlement is refused
   (`IllegalTransition` / `TaskExpired`) and only the implicit clock outcome
   stands. Independently, the honest aggregate for the *next* task still
   works while a stale one for a previous task is in flight, so staleness
   does not leak between disputes.

The reason no exploit exists is the same in every case and it is structural:
**the referent of a vote is the task id, and a task settles at most once.**
The vote's height changes which message the signatures cover; it cannot
change which task the decision is about, and the state machine enforces
single use of that task. An age limit would therefore refuse only
transactions the state machine already refuses.

An age parameter was considered and rejected: it would need a new field in
the signed payload (another consensus change) to refuse, by replay, a
decision the state machine already refuses by transition — paying a wire
change for a refusal that already exists. What *is* load-bearing, and now
covered by tests, is that a stale aggregate never blocks or corrupts the
honest work around it.

## Decision 25 - Spending policy moves on chain (P1 resolved, partly)

**Status: APPROVED 2026-10-20, IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-20 (policy types), credit pending.**

The agent policy layer of SPEC 18 was node-local: a policy constrained a
payment on the node that issued it, and the chain never saw it. That made
"bounded authority for a machine fleet" true only of the node that happened to
issue the policy. P1 asked for the payment layer to be usable by agents; the
answer is that an agent cannot be given enforceable authority while the rule
lives in one node's memory.

**The decision: agent authority is Layer-2 consensus state.**

1. **Three new Layer-2 transaction types.** `Policy` (`0x16`), `PolicyRevoke`
   (`0x17`) and `AgentSpend` (`0x18`), carried in L1 blocks like every other
   L2 payload (SPEC 19.1) and committed by the block's `l2_state_root`.
   Layer 2 and not Layer 1 because the L2 state is already replayed by every
   node and already committed, so the rule needs no new L1 header field, no
   new Merkle leaf family and no L1 undo path. A rule that every node replays
   is a rule; a rule one node checks is advice.
2. **The owner's signature binds three things at once** - the grant bytes, the
   **spender** (the key that may exercise the grant) and the **agent
   identity**. A policy hash alone is a capability; a capability anyone can
   exercise is worthless. The owner says "this key may spend under these
   caps", and the chain remembers it.
3. **The grant is the owner's signature, spent many times.** The owner signs
   once, at publication. Every later spend is authorised by the grant itself,
   signed by the spender. An agent that may act for a week does not need the
   owner online for every payment - which is the difference between a usable
   delegation scheme and a paper one.
4. **One live grant per agent.** A second grant for the same agent is refused
   while the first is live, so a second grant cannot be used to double the
   first one's caps. A revoked grant may be replaced.
5. **Revocation reaches every descendant.** A spend checks the whole
   ancestry, so the owner's kill switch covers a delegated fleet without a
   revocation transaction per link. The walk is bounded by the delegation
   depth cap and fails closed.
6. **The counters are consensus state.** `window_start_height`,
   `spent_in_window_sat`, `total_spent_sat`, `last_nonce`. Without them a
   per-window cap is a suggestion and a nonce is a formality.
7. **The money comes out of the grant owner's balance.** A grant is an
   allowance over the owner's own funds; the spender is the key that exercises
   it. The fee comes out of the same balance on top.
8. **Every rule the grant states is enforced against state the chain keeps** -
   the same rule set the node-local engine applied (SPEC 18.2), byte for byte:
   per-transaction cap, tumbling per-window cap, recipient allow-list (empty
   allows nothing), service allow-list (a tagged grant authorises no untagged
   spending), validity window, strictly increasing nonce, height may not run
   backwards inside a grant.

**What this does not change.** The node-local policy engine stays, because it
is what the HTTP API and the MCP surface still use to *issue* authorizations
offline; it is now a client of the chain's rules rather than the only place
they exist. `SpendPolicy` itself is untouched - same encoding, same hash, same
`validate` - so no existing grant byte changes meaning.

**Consensus impact.** The Layer-2 state root now covers published grants, so
the committed root changes: this is a protocol version bump (new state wire
version). The L1 genesis block carries no L2 state root, so its bytes and hash
stay unchanged; the network identity is bumped instead (mainnet magic
`6A 4E 54 01` -> `6A 4E 54 02`). It is shipped in the same version as the
credit types below, because shipping a root change twice buys nothing.

## Decision 26 - Credit becomes a chain fact (P1 resolved)

**Status: APPROVED 2026-10-20, IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-20.**

The credit facility was a node-local ledger of IOUs with three holes in it: no
coin moved when a credit line was opened, the lender never signed anything, and
no other node could see the debt. An agent could therefore "borrow" against a
line that existed only on the node it asked, against a lender who had never
agreed, and against value that was never committed to anyone.

**The decision: a loan is a Layer-2 state fact with a lender signature.**

1. **Four new Layer-2 transaction types.** `CreditOpen` (`0x19`),
   `CreditCollateral` (`0x1A`), `CreditRepay` (`0x1B`) and `CreditDefault`
   (`0x1C`), carried in L1 blocks and committed by the block's
   `l2_state_root`, exactly as the policy types of Decision 25 are.
2. **The lender signs the terms.** The lender's signature covers the
   borrower, the principal, the collateral, the rate, the window and the
   deadline. A position naming a lender who did not sign it is refused by name
   before any state changes.
3. **The principal actually moves.** The lender's balance pays the principal
   and the fee; the borrower's balance receives the principal. This is the
   difference between a credit line and a number in a spreadsheet.
4. **The collateral is the borrower's own money.** It is checked before the
   principal arrives, so the borrowed funds cannot secure the loan that
   produced them. Without a bond the requirement is full collateralisation -
   the same arithmetic the node-local book used, kept in one place.
5. **Interest is charged once per period, and interest first.** The position
   remembers the height up to which interest was charged, so two instalments
   do not each pay for the whole elapsed time; and a repayment pays the
   interest before the principal, as it always did.
6. **A default is permissionless.** Anyone may settle an overdue position,
   because a default only the lender could trigger is a default that could be
   delayed. The collateral answers for the debt, the surplus returns to the
   borrower, and the uncovered remainder is a shortfall the lender absorbs.
7. **Collateral is a conservation bucket.** `credit_locked` is part of the
   conservation sum: it is in the system, but not spendable, and the
   invariant holds after every credit transition.

**What this does not change.** The node-local credit book stays as the
service-layer view and the admission gate; the arithmetic it owns (the
collateral rule, the interest rule) is now shared with the chain rather than
re-implemented, so there is one implementation of each.

**Consensus impact.** The Layer-2 state root now covers credit positions as
well as policies and exits, and the state wire version moves to 5. Shipped in
the same protocol version as Decision 25, because a root change is a root
change.

## Decision 27 - Mainnet bootstrap committee + separate L2 settlement committee

**Status: APPROVED 2026-10-23, IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-23.** Resolves the mainnet
cold-start gap left by Decision 20 item 5.

**The decision: mainnet starts with a deterministic public 21-key committee,
and L2 settlement keeps its own fail-closed set.**

1. **Twenty-one bootstrap keys.** `NetworkParams::mainnet().genesis_validators`
   carries 21 keys derived from seeds 1..=21 under
   `srct/mainnet-validator-seed/v1`, canonically sorted by BLS public-key
   bytes. Quorum is `ceil(21 * 6667 / 10000) = 15`.
2. **Active at height 100.** Mainnet keeps `finality_activation_height = 100`
   and `checkpoint_interval_blocks = 100`, so a fresh chain can bind finality at
   its first legal checkpoint.
3. **The first bond replaces it.** With a non-empty bond ledger, committee
   selection remains the existing stake-weighted TopN 21 rule at the epoch seed
   block. With an empty ledger, the bootstrap list is the fallback. No new
   transition rule is added.
4. **The keys are public, by design.** Deterministic derivation means any node
   can sign for the bootstrap committee before a bond exists. That is accepted
   only for the bonded-stake cold start; it is not a claim of decentralisation,
   and the first bond ends it.
5. **L2 settlement is separate.** `NetworkParams::l2_settlement_validators` is a
   distinct declaration consumed by `srct_node::l2::validator_set` and the
   worker. Mainnet leaves it empty and therefore refuses every settlement by
   name. Mini/testnet use the same four keys for both sets.
6. **Genesis bytes do not change.** The committee is not part of the genesis
   block, so populating it does not alter the genesis hash.

**Operational path.** `srct-node validator --bootstrap` writes the 21 declared
keys as encrypted files on a fresh mainnet node. Checkpoint signatures are not
gossiped as partial shares, so a node needs quorum 15 locally to produce the
first certificate; the command provisions the complete committee. The keys are
public by design. After the first bond, the operator removes the bootstrap key
files because stale non-members make signing fail closed.

**Amendment 2026-10-30: bootstrap serve gate.** Serving mainnet while the
loaded keys are exactly the 21 public bootstrap keys is refused unless
`--allow-bootstrap-committee` is passed: anyone can sign alongside a
bootstrap validator until the first bond rotates authority, so cold-start
serving is an explicit operator decision, never the silent default a fresh
`--bootstrap` becomes. Mini/testnet are ungated (play money). Node policy
only — no consensus change.

**What this does not change.** No bond economics, rewards, fee share or
unbonding rules; no new consensus transaction type; no validator-yield change.
The only wire-visible effect is that mainnet checkpoints become verifiable at
height 100.

**Supersedes.** Decision 20 item 5 and P2 item 6 ("choosing the bootstrap
committee is a decision"); Decision 15's "declared active committee" for L2 is
now the separate `l2_settlement_validators` field.

## Decision 28 - Mainnet L2 settlement authority follows the live committee

**Status: APPROVED 2026-10-29, IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-29.** Resolves the
blocker left by Decision 27 item 5: mainnet's declared settlement set was
empty, so every mainnet `Settle` failed with `BadQuorum` through the real
node path — no settlement workflow (task, VWC, dispute) could complete on
the profile that matters.

**The decision: the declared set names the 21 bootstrap keys, and
verification resolves the live L1 committee per block height.**

1. **Declared set is populated.** `NetworkParams::mainnet().l2_settlement_validators`
   is the same 21 bootstrap keys that secure L1 pre-bond (quorum 15) — the
   mini/testnet precedent of reusing the L1 keys. The declaration is what
   offline verifiers use: the worker binary and one-shot checks, which have
   no chain to resolve against.
2. **Verification resolves, it does not read the declaration.**
   `Chain::settlement_committee_at(height)` returns the live L1 committee at
   that height — seed-snapshot records (lattice keys ride along) with the
   same live-ledger fallback `committee_keys` uses, genesis bootstrap when
   no bonds exist. `ChainL2::replay`/`replay_to`, `NodeL2::sync`'s
   incremental arm, `check` and `simulate_root` all resolve the set for the
   block being applied. No `NodeL2` field, no construction-time capture.
3. **Rotation revokes, exactly once.** The first bond rotates L2 authority to
   the bonded TopN under the existing seed rule — the same rule the
   settlement *builder* (miner crank, `committee_keys` at the tip) already
   used, so construction and verification agree. Bootstrap keys authorize
   nothing further: a 15-of-21 bootstrap aggregate for a post-bond task is
   refused with `BadQuorum`.
4. **Resolution is by block height, never by payload height.** The payload's
   declared height is attacker-chosen; resolving by it would let anyone cite
   a pre-rotation height and verify forever under the public bootstrap keys.
   Resolving by the applying block's height keeps every replay — whenever it
   runs — on the committee that was live when the block was built. The price
   is a liveness edge: a settle formed just before a rotation but included
   just after it is skipped deterministically (the miner rebuilds it under
   the new committee).
5. **Determinism preserved.** Replay-after-rotation verifies pre-bond history
   against the pre-bond committee, so a node that synced continuously and a
   node that replays from scratch reach identical L2 state — pinned by
   `mainnet_settlement_rotates_to_the_bonded_committee`.

**What this does not change.** No bond economics; no quorum formula; no new
transaction type; lattice sidecar enforcement is exactly as before
(BLS-only unless members registered keys — the resolution change is
membership only). The worker still verifies against the static declared set,
so after a mainnet rotation its local certificate observation goes stale
until it learns the new committee; serving the live committee over HTTP is
follow-up work, not part of this decision.

**Supersedes.** Decision 27 item 5 (the empty mainnet settlement set).

**Tests.**
`m5_node_finality::mainnet_settlement_applies_under_the_bootstrap_committee`
(pre-bond 15-of-21 settle applies through mined blocks; replay==replay),
`m5_node_finality::mainnet_settlement_rotates_to_the_bonded_committee`
(post-bond 1-of-1 bonded settle applies; pre-bond history replays
identically; bootstrap-only post-bond settle refused with `BadQuorum`).

## Decision 29 - Exit throttle and enforced high-value approval

**Status: APPROVED 2026-10-30, IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-30.** Incident-driven
hardening (hot-wallet drain playbook), two consensus-adjacent rules and one
node policy:

1. **Exit window cap (consensus).** At most `max_exit_window_sat` of exit
   principal per `exit_window_blocks` (mainnet: 1,000 SRCT per 144 blocks;
   `0` disables on mini/testnet). Over-cap queues refuse with
   `ExitWindowFull` naming the retry height; funds stay put. Both L2 queue
   accounting and the L1 release path share the rule, and windows rebuild
   from replay so reorgs need no undo bookkeeping.
2. **Large-exit extra delay (consensus).** Exits at or above
   `large_exit_threshold_sat` wait `large_exit_extra_delay_blocks` on top
   of base maturity (mainnet: 100 SRCT → +144 blocks). L2 and L1 compute the
   same delay from the same inputs. L2 wire v5 → v6.
3. **Human approval enforced (node policy, not consensus).** At or above
   `SRCT_HIGH_VALUE_THRESHOLD_SAT` the node answers `403
   human_approval_required` until a key in `SRCT_HIGH_VALUE_APPROVERS`
   co-signs the payment hash; the payer's own key does not count. Applies to
   `payment_submit` and both x402 money paths. Threshold `0` keeps
   everything off.

**What this does not change.** No fee, issuance or conservation rule; a
refused queue or payment loses nothing and retries later. The approver set
is operator config, not chain state — nodes may legitimately disagree on
who may approve, exactly like they may disagree on any local book.

**Tests.** `exit_flow` window cap + rollover and large-exit delay;
`state_wire` version pin 5 → 6; agent `verify_authorization_for_policy`
liveness matrix; 3 node-lib approval tests (missing/unlisted/self vs
listed approver).

## Decision 30 - Portable policy, verifiable delegation, enforced short-lived grants

**Status: APPROVED 2026-10-30, IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-30.** The policy layer
stays pure and non-consensus, but its answers now travel: one signed format
verifiable on any chain or rail, one proof of delegated authority, and an
approval that is enforced rather than advisory. Three library pieces, one new
crate, one MCP surface — no consensus rule:

1. **Portable grants (service layer).** `SignedPolicy` (policy + owner
   signature) and `DelegationProof` (root-first signed chain, every link
   verified, every narrowing link checked, root-first) in
   `srct-core::portable`. Verification needs only the bytes — no node, no
   state, no key. Canonical codec plus JSON with routing fields that parsing
   re-checks.
2. **Short-lived exact-transaction grants (enforced).** `BoundAuthorization`:
   the owner signs grant + expiry + exact transaction hash
   (`srct/bound-auth/v1`), 30-block lifetime cap (`MAX_BOUND_LIFETIME_BLOCKS`)
   enforced at issuance and verification. `service::admit_bound_payment`
   verifies the binding before the standard admission runs, so a stolen
   authorization re-aimed at another payment settles nothing. The node wires
   this into `payment_submit` and both x402 money paths next; the gate exists
   and is tested now.
3. **Chain-agnostic engine crate.** `crates/srct-policy` (no consensus
   imports): `decide` (portable policy JSON + intent JSON → allow / deny /
   approval-needed), `verify_proof`, `verify_audit`, with TypeScript and
   Python bindings that codec the same JSON and never re-implement a rule.
   The x402 budget guard (`X402Budget::check_guarded`: budget + short window
   before any key) and Base/Base-Sepolia rail options ride the same seam;
   the node settles SRCT options only.
4. **Wallet guard surface.** 9 keyless `srct-mcp` ops (`wallet.guard`,
   `policy.decide/export/verify`, `delegation.prove/verify`,
   `auth.bind/verify_bound`, `audit.verify`), documented in
   `docs/portable-policy.md`; audit chains export as auditor-readable JSON
   (`AuditLog::export_json` / `verify_export_json`).

**What this does not change.** No block, transaction, UTXO, supply or
finality rule; no new L2 transaction type; consensus still refuses
policy violations the way it refuses double-spends, and the service layer
still holds no key. A foreign rail vendors `srct-policy` and gets the same
decisions the node gets.

**Tests.** 5 portable unit tests (sign/verify anywhere, wrong-owner refusal,
proof narrowing, engine seam, bound expiry/tx-exactness), audit
export/tamper tests, x402 guard/lifetime/Base-route tests,
`srct-policy::decide` JSON tests, 6 MCP guard/prove/bind/audit tests.

## Decision 31 — Review findings: exit fairness, approval default, binding backends, crate weight

**Status: APPROVED 2026-10-30, IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-30.** Four code-reading
findings, each verified against the code, each fixed with its test:

1. **Exit sub-cap (consensus).** The window cap was global-only: one actor
   could fill 1,000 SRCT every window and starve every other owner until
   rollover, at fee cost. New `max_exit_per_owner_window_sat` (mainnet 100
   SRCT; pairing rules mirror the global cap's) enforced at the L2 queue —
   the only gate windows have — with `ExitOwnerWindowFull` naming the share
   and the retry height. Per-owner shares are replay-derived, travel on the
   state wire (v6 → v7, duplicate/sum/cap re-checked at decode), and reset
   on rollover. While verifying, the "L1 release path shares the rule"
   claim from Decision 29 did not survive contact with `check_claim`
   (it carries no window check — the property holds because every release
   must prove a queued record, so capping queues caps the drain): the node
   wiring comment and SPEC now state the verified truth instead.
2. **Approval default-on (node policy, not consensus).** `RiskPolicy`
   defaulted the high-value threshold to 0 everywhere, so mainnet's gate
   depended on an env var somebody might forget. New
   `from_env_for_network`: the operator's env still wins on every axis
   (explicit `0` is the documented opt-out), but a missing threshold falls
   back to 10 SRCT on `srct/mainnet` and stays disabled elsewhere. Both
   admission paths and `GET /v1/risk/policy` use the node's network.
3. **Bindings that run.** The TS/Python bindings were codecs without a
   backend. Three read-only routes now back them —
   `POST /v1/policy/decide` (intent → allow/deny/approval-needed, commits
   nothing; a deny is a 200 with the reason so a "no" is never mistaken for
   a transport failure), `/v1/delegation/verify`, `/v1/audit/verify` — with
   `NodeHttpBackend` in both bindings (stdlib only, no toolchain) and a
   runnable demo (`sim/policy_decide_demo.py --self-test`, then live
   against a node). Verified live: same node, same grant — allow, deny and
   approval-needed all answered over real HTTP.
4. **Crate weight, stated honestly.** `srct-policy` stays a stable API
   facade over `srct-core`'s pure modules — vendoring it still compiles
   BLS/ML-DSA and all; the crate docs say so, and extracting a crypto-light
   codec crate is recorded follow-up, not done here (splitting the bundles
   risks two implementations of one rule). Outsiders get decisions over
   HTTP or the bindings instead. The facade earns its keep meanwhile: 5
   tests pinning decide/proof/audit/guard agreement.

**Tests.** Per-owner refusal/admission/rollover/roundtrip/tamper
(`exit_flow`), pairing rules (`params`, `L2Config`), wire pin v7
(`state_wire` + offsets), mainnet-default matrix (`safety`) + mini endpoint
shape (`micro_safety`), decide/verify routes over real HTTP (`api`), 5
`srct-policy` tests, Python demo self-test, clippy clean.

## Decision 32 — Security review: audit visibility, routing confusion, engine-owned network

**Status: APPROVED 2026-10-31, IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-31.** A review pass over
policy, wallet and security code. Most of it held — signatures validate
before verifying (empty bundles, high-S, lengths all refused), nonces are
strict, windows roll forward with overflow checks, delegation pins
owner/network/role/link/derivation, requests bind signer to payer, the x402
inner path gates like submit. Four real gaps, each fixed with its test:

1. **Silent audit loss.** A full ring refused writes (`AuditFull`) but the
   operator had no signal: `audit_push` ignores the refusal and the export
   said nothing. The ring now counts `dropped`, reported by `GET /v1/audit`
   and carried (not proven — stated as the ring's own admission) by the
   export; old exports without the field still verify via `#[serde(default)]`.
2. **Routing-field confusion.** Portable JSON carried `agent_id`,
   `network_id` (policy) and `leaf_agent` (proof) that parsing never
   re-checked against the decoded grant — a document could route one way
   and verify another. All routing fields are now cross-checked at parse.
3. **Network binding lived in wrappers, not the engine.** `evaluate_policy`
   never checked the rail; each caller re-checked. The check is now clause
   one of the engine (`policy is for network X, asked on Y` denies), and
   the MCP/crate/HTTP wrappers pass through instead of duplicating.
4. **Correction, not code:** Decision 29's "L1 release path shares the rule"
   was already corrected in Decision 31 after contact with `check_claim`;
   this pass re-verified it while mapping every money path through
   `risk_gate`: submit and settle share `admit_machine_payment_inner`
   (which gates), escrow release gates, stream settlement moves no coin
   outside `payment_submit`.

**Tests.** `dropped` counting/export/compat + `/v1/audit` pin
(`micro_safety`), routing-tamper parse refusals (policy + proof), engine
cross-network deny, wrapper pass-through (MCP/crate/endpoint suites green).
