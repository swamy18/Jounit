# Protocol decisions — D3 (L2 fees) and §14.6 (validator economics)

Recorded as the protocol owner's standing decisions. **Neither decision changes
any runtime rule today**: no code activates, the 40M supply cap, mining
economics, block rewards and monetary policy are untouched. They become
*operative* only when their enabling phases are built (D3 → first L2 tx type,
Phase 2; §14.6 → testnet activation gate, Phase 6), each behind an explicit,
reviewable change.

---

## Decision 1 — D3: L2 fee path = Option 3 (own schedule, same 50/50 split)

**Chosen: the L2 transaction types get their own flat fee schedule, and the
flat fee is split by the existing M1 mechanism, not bypassed.**

- The five flat fees already recorded in `params.rs`
  (`FEE_TX_*_SAT`: post 5 000 / claim 2 000 / submit 2 000 / dispute 10 000 /
  settle 20 000 sats) are confirmed as the L2 fee schedule for testnet.
- For an L2 transaction, the flat fee *is* `full_base` in `split_fees`: the
  M1 50/50 burn/PSCB invariant holds unchanged, one rule for both fee kinds.
- **The L1 gas floor (`base_fee * gas_used`) is untouched.** L2 transactions do
  not get an exemption; they simply ride a second, explicit schedule. No second
  base fee, no second congestion controller (option 4 stays rejected; it can be
  added later without breaking this decision).
- When the first L2 tx type is implemented (Phase 2), `check_tx`/the mempool
  fee check will route L2-type transactions to `L2_FEE_SCHEDULE` and everything
  else to the gas floor. The existing tripwire test
  (`l2_flat_fees_sit_below_the_gas_floor`) is then replaced by positive tests
  that L2 txs pay exactly the flat fee and are split 50/50.
- Sanity: 20 000 sats (max L2 fee) = 0.0002 JNT. At the mini profile this is
  cheap for workers; the schedule can be re-parameterised at mainnet without a
  consensus-format change (values live in `params.rs` constants).

Why not the others: option 1 (raise fees) contradicts the predictability
motivation for flat fees; option 2 (exemption) creates a widening-by-accident
exception; option 4 (separate fee market) is disproportionate mechanism for
five tx types today.

**Scope note:** D3 fixes *transaction fees only*. It does not decide task
*payments* (what a submitter pays a worker for compute) — that is a market
price set per-TaskContract by the participants (`payment_jnt`), never a
protocol rule.

---

## Decision 2 — §14.6: validator economics (design-only, activation stays Phase 6)

The five open items are decided as follows, values parameterised in
`NetworkParams` at implementation time, none wired into consensus now:

1. **Minimum stake: 5 000 JNT** (`min_validator_stake_sat`), **bonded** with
   unbonding after a full finality window (`finality_depth` blocks) so a
   departing validator cannot sign a checkpoint the chain cannot hold them to.
   Rationale: meaningful skin-in-the-game at ~0.0125% of supply; low enough for
   a wide testnet set.
2. **Selection: TopN over staked candidates, N = 21** — the already-implemented
   `SelectionRule::TopN` default. Stake-weighted sampling is explicitly
   rejected for now (unimplemented machinery, weaker auditability). For testnet
   Phase 6, a **fixed genesis committee of the TopN stakers at the genesis
   epoch** is the bootstrap mode; rotation switches on only after the chain is
   stable.
3. **Rewards: none for now.** Checkpoint signing earns **no new issuance and no
   fee share** at testnet. Revisit only if testnet shows signing liveness
   problems. (This deliberately leaves monetary policy exactly as it is.)
4. **Slashing for equivocation: burn the equivocator's entire bond**
   (5 000 JNT). Evidence = the already-exposed `equivocation_evidence`
   (two valid conflicting signed checkpoints, same key). 100% seizure is
   justified because equivocation is unambiguous, non-accidental, and attacks
   finality itself. The `slash.rs` vault handles the mechanics (vested
   claims, M2 interplay); equivocation slashing writes a full-bond SlashRecord.
   L2 dispute slashing (M2 amounts for fraudulent work) is *unchanged* — that
   was never part of the §14.6 open items.
5. **Activation: end of Phase 6 (public testnet), not before.** Sequence: L1
   testnet live → fixed committee signs checkpoints (finality visible but
   non-binding) → only after chaos testing passes, finality becomes binding
   (no reorg past checkpoint) in a separate, reviewable change. BLS/M5
   consensus activation is therefore still gated on its own explicit step.

**Standing rule reaffirmed:** anything that changes `Chain::submit` behaviour,
issuance, or fork choice requires its own review before it merges. These
decisions specify *what will be built when their phase starts*; they do not
build it now.

---

## Implementation pointers (for the phases that consume these decisions)

- D3 → Phase 2 (Step 6 tx types): add `l2_fee_for(tx_type)` and route the flat
  fee through `split_fees` as `full_base`.
- §14.6 → Phase 6: `min_validator_stake_sat`, `validator_count` (21), bonded
  stake accounting, equivocation → full-bond SlashRecord, fixed-committee
  bootstrap mode, activation flag.

# Gap audit — 6-phase L2 roadmap vs. what exists today

Audited 2026-10-06 against `docs/roadmap.md` §8 build order and the actual
crate tree (`jnt-core`, `jnt-net`, `jnt-store`, `jnt-node` — no `jnt-l2`,
no `jnt-worker` yet). Verdict per phase, with only genuinely-missing work
listed as remaining.

## Phase 1 — L1 production-ready (Steps 1+2): **DONE**
- Mempool (`mempool.rs`): byte-bounded, fee-rate ordered, conflict-checked,
  integrated into `Chain` (`mine_from_pool`, reorg re-admission). 20+ tests.
- Persistent storage (`jnt-store`): append-only record log, crash recovery with
  reported torn tails, canonical height index, UTXO snapshots, adversarial
  fuzz/invariant coverage.
- Transaction relay over P2P (§13.14, `Tx` message) — shipped earlier in the
  session, tests in `jnt-net/tests/tx_relay.rs`.
- Real BLS via blst (`bls.rs`), storage fuzzing, checkpoint envelope (§14.4),
  validator-set machinery as an inert library (§14.6).
**Remaining: nothing for Phase 1 itself.**

## Phase 2 — TaskContract + state machine (Step 3) + Step 6 tx types: **NOT STARTED**
Requires crate `crates/jnt-l2/`:
- `TaskContract` struct + `ContractState` machine (Open → InProgress →
  ResultSubmitted → Disputed → Settled/Expired) with the 7 listed methods.
- The 5 L2 transaction types in `jnt-core/src/tx.rs` (TxPostTask, TxClaimTask,
  TxSubmitResult, TxDispute, TxSettle): Writer/Reader serialization,
  domain-separated signing hashes, validation rules, round-trip tests.
- **Unblocked now** by Decision 1 (fee path) — first thing to build.
Dependencies ready: `ComputeTask`/`ComputeAttestation` (compute_ir.rs),
mempool, store, fee schedule constants.

## Phase 3 — Dispute engine + M2/M1 wiring (Step 4): **NOT STARTED**
- `DisputeChallenge`, `DisputeVerdict`, `DisputeEngine::arbitrate/apply_verdict`
  in `crates/jnt-l2/src/dispute.rs`.
- Wiring (all primitives exist): `SlashVault` (slash.rs — vested SlashRecords,
  exhaustion), PSCB reserve on `Chain` (per-block undo maps for reorg
  correctness), whistleblower bonus from PSCB.
- Needs a re-execution verdict path: CPU-reference evaluation of M3 IR
  (roadmap §11 open question 2) — small spec item to write before coding.
**Blocked by Phase 2** (contracts must exist to dispute).

## Phase 4 — VWC issuance + tx types in jnt-core (Steps 5+6): **NOT STARTED**
- `VerifiedWorkCertificate` (`vwc.rs`): signing_hash over all fields,
  canonical serialization, quorum-gated `verify`, store lookup by task/worker.
- Note: the Step-6 tx-type work is listed under Phase 2 above (roadmap lists
  Steps 5+6 in one phase; Step 6 logically lands with the contract phase).
**Blocked by Phase 3** (a settled outcome is what a certificate certifies).

## Phase 5 — Worker client / SDK (Step 7): **NOT STARTED**
- New crate `crates/jnt-worker/`: node connection via jnt-net, task scanning,
  claim/execute/submit loop, M4 HBM proof (hbm_pow.rs exists), earnings.
- CLI (`jnt-worker run/status/earnings`) + `WorkerClient` SDK struct.
**Blocked by Phases 2+4** (nothing to claim or certify until then).

## Phase 6 — Integration + public testnet: **PARTIALLY PREPARED, NOT STARTED**
Already in place: jnt-node CLI with serve/relay, P2P networking with ban
scoring and keepalives, storage recovery, fuzz-smoke CI, difficulty-attack
sims, 360 tests.
Remaining for testnet:
- Wire all modules end-to-end in jnt-node (L2 tx handling, dispute flow,
  checkpoint relay message type — §13.5 addition, needs a vector-stable
  decision).
- Multi-node testnet tooling (compose/systemd scripts, seeds), chaos testing
  (dispute storms, partitions), bug-bounty program.
- §14.6 activation gate at the END of this phase, per Decision 2: fixed
  genesis committee signs (non-binding) first; binding finality is a separate
  reviewable change after chaos testing.

## Cross-cutting (safe to build in any order, not blind-built now)
- §14.6 economics implementation (stake accounting, slashing wiring) —
  decided above, built with Phase 6, not before.
- D3 fee routing in check_tx/mempool — built with Phase 2's first tx type.
- Agent integration layer (§12: REST API, MCP server, ElizaOS, LangChain) —
  separate roadmap section, none started; independent of Phases 2–5.
- Longer fuzz campaigns (WSL now works), more CI hardening — continuous.

## Verdict summary
| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — L1 production | DONE |
| 2 — TaskContract + L2 txs | NOT STARTED (unblocked by Decision 1) |
| 3 — Dispute engine | NOT STARTED (needs Phase 2) |
| 4 — VWC issuance | NOT STARTED (needs Phase 3) |
| 5 — Worker SDK | NOT STARTED (needs Phases 2+4) |
| 6 — Testnet + finality activation | PREPARED, gated on 2–5 |

Recommended next: **Phase 2** — `jnt-l2` crate skeleton + TaskContract state
machine + the five L2 tx types with D3 fee routing, in that order, with the
M3-CPU-reference spec note written before Phase 3 starts.
