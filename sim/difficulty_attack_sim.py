"""Difficulty-manipulation simulation (design doc sections 28.9 / 28.10).

The design doc's section 28.9 table quotes a `difficulty_attack_sim.py`
that was never written. This is that file. It answers one question:

    How much future-timestamp leeway does a miner need before it can
    drag network difficulty down, and what does each allowance cost?

Two things fell out of writing it, and they change the story the design
doc tells.

WHAT THE PROTOCOL ACTUALLY DOES
-------------------------------
Consensus enforces one timestamp rule: a block's timestamp may not be
*below* the median of the previous eleven (`validate_timestamp`). There
is no consensus ceiling, because a ceiling needs a reference that
advances with wall time and the only such thing is the local clock.
The ceiling is therefore node policy (`validate_local_clock`), with a
width of `future_limit_ms` = one block time.

An honest miner writes `max(local_clock, median)` into the timestamp
(see `chain.rs` `mine_block_with`). That is the whole defence, and it
is enough: a minority attacker is outvoted six-to-five in the median,
so it cannot pull the median ahead of real time. Honest blocks keep
stamping at real time no matter how far ahead the attacker stamps.

Three further consensus bounds then make the attack inert:

  * the solve-time clamp [T/4, 5T]  -- a single retarget can only ask
    for a difficulty in [0.25, 5];
  * the per-block change limit (+/-10%) -- the retarget can only move
    one step at a time;
  * `min_difficulty = 1` -- difficulty can never reach zero, so block
    time can never fall below the target spacing.

With those in place a 40% attacker cannot make blocks come *faster*
than target at any allowance. Measured: block time stays within ~1% of
target from a one-minute allowance up to Bitcoin's two hours.

WHY SECTION 28.9'S NUMBERS DIFFER
---------------------------------
The design doc reports a 40% attacker with a two-hour allowance
reaching ~104s average block time. That is impossible under this
specification: 104s is below the solve-time clamp floor (T/4 = 150s),
so no retarget can ask for a difficulty that low. The simulation
cannot reproduce the section 28.9 table from this protocol, and
`--ablation` shows that stripping the clamp and the difficulty floor
drives difficulty to zero rather than to the reported figure, so the
original table must have been produced by some further difference in
its model that is not recoverable from the document.

Run with no arguments for the protocol's behaviour; `--ablation`
removes one rule at a time to show which one is load-bearing.

Limit: a toy model. No latency variance, no selfish-mining subtlety,
no second attacker -- as the design doc's own note says.
