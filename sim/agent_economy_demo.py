"""Agent-economy demo (envelope level, stdlib only).

Mirrors the Rust tests without keys: tier narrowing math, USD-quote math,
passport scoring with counterparty dampening, and the job lifecycle.

    python sim/agent_economy_demo.py

The cryptography (owner signatures, BLS attestations) lives in the Rust
wallet and node tests (`cargo test -p srct-node --test agent_economy`).
