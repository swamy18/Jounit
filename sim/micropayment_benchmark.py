"""Micro-payment cost/latency benchmark (prints the table, asserts the math).

Regenerates the numbers `docs/micropayments.md` commits to from the consensus
constants (`GAS_TX_BASE/_INPUT/_OUTPUT`, base-fee schedule) and checks them
against the Rust implementation (`BatchQuote::price`, `aggregate_payments`).

Run directly:

    python sim/micropayment_benchmark.py

What it measures:
- on-chain cost: gas * base fee for 1 separate settlement vs 1 shared batch
  settlement vs 1 stream-channel settlement for N units of work;
- off-chain latency: everything except the chain (verify/admit/quote) is
  microseconds in-process — the chain confirmation (blocks, not code) is the
  latency floor, so fewer transactions is fewer waits.
