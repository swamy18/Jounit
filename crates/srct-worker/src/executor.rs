//! The execution seam (SPEC.md §18.6).
//!
//! Execution is the SDK's one pluggable boundary: the operator supplies an
//! [`Executor`] (CPU worker, GPU worker, AI agent loop, external compute
//! service); the SDK routes the task's commitment hashes to it and hashes the
//! output into the result the protocol sees. Execution holds no keys, no state
//! handle and no broadcast path — isolation by type, not by convention.
//!
//! The SDK ships exactly one executor ([`CpuExecutor`]): the SPEC.md §16
//! CPU-reference shape, needed by tests and by dispute observation. Everything
//! real roots its own `Executor` impl; the SDK never interprets `ir_hash` or
//! `input_hash` (fetching off-chain IR is the operator's transport).
