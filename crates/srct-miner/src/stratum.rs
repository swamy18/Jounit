//! Stratum-lite v1: minimal JSON-lines job server for pool operators.
//!
//! The node serves one miner via `GET /v1/mine/template`; a pool serves many.
//! This module is that pool side: it hands out jobs (unsolved templates),
//! validates submitted shares, and forwards full-difficulty blocks through a
//! caller-provided submit callback (normally `POST /v1/mine/submit`).
//!
//! Protocol: newline-delimited JSON over TCP.
//!
//! ```text
//! miner -> {"method":"getjob","miner":"<20-byte hex>"}
//! pool  -> {"job_id":7,"height":123,"difficulty":"1000","puzzle_id":1,"block_hex":"..."}
//! miner -> {"method":"submit","job_id":7,"miner":"<20-byte hex>","block_hex":"..."}
//! pool  -> {"accepted":true,"share":true,"block":false}
//! ```
//!
//! Anti-theft rule: the submitted block must match the job's `prev_hash`,
//! `height`, `difficulty`, `puzzle_id` and `merkle_root` exactly — only
//! `nonce`, `extra_nonce` and `timestamp` may differ. A miner that swaps the
//! coinbase (or any transaction) changes the merkle root and the share is
//! refused. Proof validity is re-checked by the pool with the same rule the
//! node uses; the node re-checks again at submit.
//!
//! Share difficulty: the pool accepts proofs meeting a weaker `share_difficulty`
//! as shares for accounting, and forwards only proofs that also meet the
//! job's network difficulty as blocks. Found blocks close a PPLNS round over
//! the trailing window (see [`crate::payout`]): pool hopping has no timing
//! edge because every share in the window is worth the same. Share and payout
//! accounting is in-memory; moving actual coin on chain stays the operator's
//! job (`mark_paid` records it).
//!
//! Known non-fixable: block withholding. A miner who finds a full-difficulty
//! proof and never submits it is indistinguishable from an unlucky one — no
//! pool protocol can tell them apart. The damage is bounded by construction:
//! a withheld block earns no share (nothing was submitted) and the round it
//! would have closed stays open, so the withholder dilutes their own window
//! weight along with everyone else's.
