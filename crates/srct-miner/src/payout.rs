//! Pool payout ledger: PPLNS (pay-per-last-N-shares) round accounting.
//!
//! A *round* is the shares standing between two blocks the pool finds (or
//! between startup and the first block). When the pool finds a block paying
//! `coinbase_sat` to the pool address, [`RoundTracker::finalize_block`]
//! splits the reward across the **last `window` shares**, not the round:
//!
//! - the pool takes `fee_bps` basis points off the top (tracked as
//!   `operator_earned`, never mixed with miner money),
//! - the rest plus carried dust is split proportionally to shares **inside
//!   the window**, floored to whole sats,
//! - the flooring remainder (dust) is **not** kept by the operator: it
//!   carries into the next round's pot, so miners lose nothing to rounding.
//!
//! Why a window and not the round (PROP): under proportional-per-round
//! accounting a share submitted early in a long round is worth less than one
//! submitted late, so a miner who only mines fresh rounds earns more per hash
//! than a loyal one — pool hopping. Under PPLNS every share in the window is
//! worth exactly the same no matter when it landed, so there is no timing
//! edge to exploit. The window is `2 × network_difficulty /
//! share_difficulty` (≈ two blocks' worth of shares), bounded by
//! [`PPLNS_MAX_WINDOW`] so the share log is bounded memory.
//!
//! A round with no shares in the window pays the whole pot to the carry
//! (minus the fee): there is nobody to pay, and the dust rule keeps it miner
//! money.
//!
//! This ledger is accounting only. Moving actual coin is the operator's
//! on-chain transfer; [`RoundTracker::mark_paid`] records it so a miner is
//! never paid twice. All iteration is over ordered structures, so identical
//! share sequences produce byte-identical round records on every machine.
