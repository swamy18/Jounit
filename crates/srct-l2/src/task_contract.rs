//! This module holds the *transitions only*: no balances, no fees, no BLS. Every
//! method either refuses an illegal transition with a named error or changes the
//! state, and nothing here can move value. The economy lives in
//! [`crate::state::L2State`], which is the only thing that debits an account and
//! the only thing that consults a validator set. That split is deliberate: it is
//! what lets the transitions be tested exhaustively without a wallet, and what
//! keeps "who pays" from being tangled with "may this happen".
//!
//! The dispute window is a protocol parameter ([`crate::L2Config`]), not a field
//! an actor chooses. A submitter who could pick their own window could pick a
//! zero-length one; a worker who could pick it could make challenges impossible.
