//! L2 state rebuilt from the canonical L1 chain — Decision 6, SPEC.md §19.1.
//!
//! # Why this lives here and not in `srct-core`
//!
//! L2 state is a pure function of the canonical chain: the L2 transactions are
//! carried in L1 blocks and committed by each block's merkle root, so every node
//! that replays the same blocks in the same order reaches the same state. That
//! function needs *both* crates — `Chain` to read blocks, `L2State` to apply
//! them — and the dependency direction is `srct-l2 → srct-core`. Putting the
//! replay here therefore adds no dependency edge and, more importantly, requires
//! no change to `Chain::submit`: L1 block validity is not made to depend on L2
//! rules, which is the property that keeps this integration from touching
//! consensus.
//!
//! # The one ordering rule
//!
//! For each height, the clock advances first (`L2State::advance_block`), then
//! the block's own L2 transactions are applied in block order, then the
//! block's detected deposits are processed in output order. That order is
//! fixed and stated once, because two nodes must agree on whether a transaction
//! that lands on the same height as an expiry sees the task open or expired.
//! Vesting and expiry happen *at* the height; the block's transactions then act
//! on the result. Deposits credit recipient accounts, never tasks, so their
//! position after the transactions is observable only in balances.
//!
//! Deposit maturity is evaluated against the *tip*, not the block: a deposit
//! detected at height `h` credits once `tip − h ≥ finality_depth`. Full replay
//! evaluates every deposit at the final tip; the incremental path evaluates new
//! blocks at the new tip and rebuilds by full replay when an old pending
//! deposit matures (`has_pending_matured`), so the two paths cannot disagree.
//!
//! # Binding finality (Decision 15, SPEC.md §19.4.1)
//!
//! Depth is the *minimum* safety, never the whole of it. Once the L1 chain has
//! a binding checkpoint (Decision 12), a deposit also requires that its own
//! block height lies at or below the binding-finalized height — so depth alone
//! cannot make a deposit spendable when the canonical history it sits in is not
//! yet finalized. Before binding finality activates (the finalized height is
//! 0), the M3 depth rule governs alone, unchanged: this gate can only make
//! deposits *safer* than M3, never less safe. The binding floor is read from
//! the L1 [`Chain`]'s own finality layer — L2 never grows a second finality
//! system; it consumes the one consensus answer.
//!
//! # What replay does with a transaction that does not apply
//!
//! It records it in [`ChainL2::skipped`] and carries on. This is deliberate and
//! documented in Decision 6: L2 validity is not an L1 block-validity rule, so a
//! miner *can* include an L2 transaction that fails — and every other node must
//! then reach the same conclusion about it, which it does, because `apply` is a
//! pure function of state and the rejection is deterministic. The transaction is
//! not marked applied, so it stays retryable, and nothing about it can corrupt
//! state. Recording the list rather than ignoring it is what makes that visible:
//! a node can report which payloads in a block it refused, and why.
