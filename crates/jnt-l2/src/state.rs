//! `L2State`: the deterministic value layer under the task contracts.
//!
//! This is where an L2 transaction actually *does* something. `TaskContract`
//! decides whether a transition is legal; this module decides who pays, in what
//! order, and where every satoshi ends up.
//!
//! Three rules define the model:
//!
//! 1. **Accounts, not UTXOs.** L2 carries a simple account balance per address.
//!    Funding is genesis-explicit ([`L2State::apply_genesis`], SPEC.md §19.4):
//!    the profile's escrow total is released once — grants to named accounts,
//!    remainder to the protocol escrow identity. Two later production credits
//!    exist and both ride L1 blocks: matured deposits (Decision 10,
//!    `apply_deposit`) and the exit debits that pair with them (Decision 19).
//!    What is real today is the accounting below them.
//! 2. **Every explicit transaction pays its D3 flat fee**, split 50/50
//!    burned/PSCB through `fees::split_flat_fee` — the unchanged M1 rule. Implicit
//!    transitions (a deadline passing, a dispute window closing) cost nothing,
//!    because nothing was transacted.
//! 3. **Value is conserved.** An L2 fee or a slashed deposit is *moved*, never
//!    conjured: burned and PSCB satoshis leave the account set and land in the
//!    counters, and a slashed deposit lands in the M2 vault. `conservation_total`
//!    is the check, and the integration tests assert it after every scenario.
//!
//! Replay is refused by transaction id, and a failed transaction is not marked
//! applied — a transaction that was rejected for a transient reason (a task not
//! yet posted) can be retried once the precondition holds, but it can never be
//! applied twice.
