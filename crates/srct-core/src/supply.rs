//! Halving-ladder supply schedule with the approved tail. SPEC.md §7.
//!
//! Design doc Section 16: 76 SRCT per block, halving every 262 800 blocks
//! (5 years) over an 8-rung whole-SRCT ladder. The ladder is followed by the
//! tail approved 2026-10-09 (`docs/decisions.md` M-A..M-C): mainnet decays
//! 0.50 → 0.25 → 0.125 SRCT to a permanent 0.1 SRCT floor; fast profiles pay a
//! constant 1-sat token tail. The load-bearing mint bound is the issuance
//! integral `cumulative_issuance_sat(height)`. After the approved relocation of
//! the conservation-anchor and escrow-backing jobs (M-D/M-E, shipped 2026-10-09)
//! and Stage SA-1 (Decision 18), `supply_cap_sat` is gone from the mint bound and
//! the report; the rate anchor (Stage SA-3) is the only cap left.
