//! The opt-in service API (Decision 9, roadmap §13, SPEC.md §19.2).
//!
//! `srct-node serve --api-listen <addr>` starts an HTTP/REST server beside the
//! P2P daemon. Disabled by default; loopback is the expected binding and a
//! non-loopback bind prints a warning, because exposing this port is an
//! operator decision (§19.2).
//!
//! # What this is, and what it is not
//!
//! - **Not a consensus surface.** Nothing here reaches `Chain::submit`. The
//!   only writes are: an L1 transaction that passes the exact `pool.add` path
//!   a peer's relayed transaction passes, and an L2 transaction that passes a
//!   dry-run against a *clone* of L2 state and then waits in a queue for a
//!   block to carry it — L2 state is still derived from canonical blocks
//!   alone (SPEC §19.1).
//! - **No signing, ever.** The API never sees a private key. `POST
//!   /v1/tx/build` returns *unsigned* bytes for the caller to sign;
//!   `POST /v1/authorize` returns the authorization bytes and their signing
//!   hash for the owner to sign. Refusals never echo signing material.
//! - **Bounded everything.** One body-size cap for all inputs; the receipt
//!   book, payment store and policy book are cap-with-refusal, so a flood
//!   cannot grow node memory without bound.
//! - **State it holds is non-consensus and node-local**: receipts, payment
//!   ids, policy accounting and the credit book (`CreditBook`: free balances,
//!   bonds, positions) are this node's view for lookup/authorization
//!   convenience. They are never consensus, but they do survive a restart:
//!   the serve command persists them to `state.bin` (atomic, digest-checked,
//!   fail-closed load) and flushes at shutdown. A bad file can only cost this
//!   node its own bookkeeping — it can never mint or move a coin.
//!
//! Endpoints (§13 for L1, §19.2 for the L2 additions, plus the payment/
//! receipt surface items 16–17 require):

//! always the total before pagination, and `next_cursor` carries the offset
//! for the next page or `null` on the last one.
//!
//! # Exposure and its guards
//!
//! Loopback is the default binding and is unauthenticated by design: every test
//! drives a socket on `127.0.0.1:0` with no token. A **non-loopback bind is
//! refused** unless a bearer token is supplied, because exposing this surface is
//! an operator decision the node will not make silently (SPEC.md §19.2).
//!
//! - **Host-header validation runs on *every* bind**, loopback included.
//!   On a loopback bind only loopback names pass (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`,
//!   `::1`, any loopback IP literal). On a non-loopback bind any IP literal
//!   passes too — DNS rebinding cannot use an IP literal — plus the bound
//!   address and the operator's allowlisted names (`--api-allowed-host` /
//!   `SRCT_API_ALLOWED_HOSTS`). Anything else, including a missing or
//!   bracket-malformed `Host`, is 403.
//! - **Bearer authentication on an exposed bind** — every request carries
//!   `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, compared in constant time. Supply the
//!   token through the `SRCT_API_TOKEN` environment variable, not
//!   `--api-token`: command-line flags are visible to other users in `ps`,
//!   while the environment of a started process is not.
//! - **A per-IP token bucket on an exposed bind** — a flood is shed to the
//!   server. The table is bounded (idle entries are evicted), so a spray of
//!   source addresses cannot grow it without limit.
//! - **A per-request deadline and a global in-flight cap** — these apply on
//!   *every* binding, loopback included, because they bound the hold time on
//!   the shared-state `Mutex` rather than defending against a remote attacker.
