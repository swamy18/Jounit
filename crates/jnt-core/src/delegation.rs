//! `delegation`: attenuated delegation chains (roadmap item 3).
//!
//! ```text
//! Owner ──▶ Agent ──▶ Sub-agent ──▶ ...
//! ```
//!
//! Each level inherits a **strict subset** of its parent's `SpendPolicy`. A
//! sub-agent cannot widen anything: not the per-transaction cap, not the
//! cumulative cap, not the recipient set, not the service set, not the expiry,
//! not the window. This module is the one place that rule lives, so the
//! narrowing is the same code everywhere and is audited once.
//!
//! ## Why domination, not inheritance-shaped-like
//!
//! The obvious implementation inherits *what is not overridden*. That is the
//! wrong default here: a child that sets nothing inherits everything, so the
//! safe configuration is silence, and a mistake reads as a narrower policy. The
//! check here is the opposite — **every field must be dominated, or the chain
//! is refused** — so the safe configuration is the default and widening is
//! impossible to do by omission.
//!
//! ## What this module is not
//!
//! Not a consensus rule, and not a new transaction type. The policy layer it
//! extends (`crate::agent`) is pure library and is not consulted by any
//! consensus path — nothing in `submit_at` reads a `PolicyBook`, and nothing
//! here changes that. Delegation narrows what an *offline* authorization may
//! grant; it decides no block's validity.
//!
//! ## The order of a chain
//!
//! A chain is a slice of policies, **root first**, ending at the policy that
//! will actually authorize a spend:
//!
//! ```text
//! [root, child, grandchild]   // grandchild spends, under both above it
//! ```
//!
//! `assert_chain` checks every adjacent pair with `dominates`, so the rule
//! composes: a chain is valid exactly when every link narrows.
