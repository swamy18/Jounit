//! Layer-2 transaction types. Decision D3, `docs/decisions.md`.
//!
//! Jounit's L2 is the verified-work marketplace: a submitter posts a compute
//! task with a locked payment, a worker claims and runs it, and settlement
//! releases the payment against a verdict. A sixth type, `ExitQueue`, moves
//! value the other way — out of L2 and back to L1 (Decision 19, SPEC.md §19.6).
//! These six payload types are the protocol vocabulary for that loop.
//!
//! Scope, stated precisely because it is easy to over-read: these are *payload*
//! types. They are validated and fee-routed here — the flat D3 schedule routes
//! through `fees::split_flat_fee`, so the L1 `base_fee · gas_used` floor is
//! untouched and no exemption is created. M1 (SPEC.md §19.1) carries them inside
//! L1 blocks as a length-prefixed trailer committed by
//! `block::merkle_root_with_l2`.
//!
//! Nothing here changes the L1 fee floor, the L1 gas model, or any frozen
//! vector: a block with no L2 transactions still encodes byte-identically to the
//! pre-M1 format.
//!
//! Encoding discipline, matching the rest of `jnt-core`:
//! - Every payload is canonically encodable: `serialize`/`from_reader` are exact
//!   inverses, and every length prefix is bounded before it drives an
//!   allocation.
//! - Authorization payloads commit to an explicit actor address and a signature
//!   bundle over a domain-separated signing hash. The hash covers the key bundle
//!   but not the signature bundle, exactly as the L1 `sighash` does.
//! - `Settle` has no single signer: its authorization is a validator-quorum BLS
//!   aggregate, reusing the M5 `ValidatorSet`/`BlsVerifier` machinery. The
//!   aggregate covers the same domain-separated hash, so a settle decision
//!   cannot be replayed at another task or verdict.
//!
//! Fees are the flat D3 schedule (`params::FEE_TX_*`). They are charged on a
//! path of their own through `fees::split_flat_fee`, which keeps the M1 50/50
//! burn/PSCB invariant and leaves the L1 `base_fee * gas_used` floor untouched.
