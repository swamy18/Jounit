//! `credit`: bond-backed credit terms (roadmap item 2, decision D1).
//!
//! An agent with a demonstrated record can borrow against future work instead of
//! pre-funding every transaction. **D1 fixes the shape, and it is worth stating
//! plainly because the obvious design is the wrong one:**
//!
//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | **Reputation** | A deterministic **view**, read off on-chain events. Never a consensus input. |
//! | **Credit** | Always **collateralized**. A posted bond *discounts* the requirement, nothing more. |
//!
//! Two rules that follow, and are the whole reason this module is safe:
//!
//! ## 1. A bond discounts the requirement; it does not replace it
//!
//! [CreditTerms::required_collateral] returns `max(base, amount - discount)`, and
//! the discount is capped at a fraction of `amount`. It never returns less than
//! `MIN_COLLATERAL_RATIO` of the amount, whatever the agent's score or bond. There
//! is **no path to a zero-collateral line**, which is what "undercollateralized"
//! means here: *under*, not *un*.
//!
//! ## 2. Reputation is an input to a lender's decision, not to a protocol rule
//!
//! The score affects the discount a lender may *offer*. It does not affect
//! `required_collateral` except through the terms the lender chose, and no
//! consensus rule reads it. This matters for a specific reason: a credit limit
//! computed on-chain from a mutable score would make every reputation update a
//! consensus event and make fresh identities farmable, which is the cheapest
//! attack against the gate and the most expensive to defend.
//!
//! The consequence, accepted deliberately: a brand-new agent with score 0 gets no
//! discount but still gets a line, because it can still post collateral. That is
//! the correct outcome — reputation buys better terms, not access. It also means
//! this module is not a Sybil surface: farming an id yields nothing, because
//! nothing gates on the id.
//!
//! # What this module is not
//!
//! Not a lending protocol. It is the arithmetic that decides *how much*
//! collateral a given position needs, and the tests that pin the invariants. The
//! position itself, its lifecycle and its settlement belong to whoever wires this
//! up — and they must be built so a default is paid out of the bond, not out of
//! the reputation.
