//! Chain state: validation, application, fork choice, reorg, finality.
//! SPEC.md §9.

//! Fork choice is heaviest cumulative difficulty. Selection is deterministic:
//! ties break on lower height, then on the lowest block hash, so two nodes
//! holding the same set of valid blocks always agree on the tip. (An earlier
//! version of this comment claimed a first-seen tie-break; that was the arrival
//! counter bug, since fixed — the comment outlived the code and misdescribed a
