//! L2 state-root commitment and Merkle inclusion proofs (SPEC.md §19.2, P1).
//!
//! This is the **proof half** of the approved L2 → L1 exit rule (Decision 10
//! as amended 2026-10-09, E-1 = (a)). An exit needs L1 to verify that a
//! claimed L2 balance really exists in the L2 state; L2 state is *derived by
//! replay* and is not committed anywhere L1 can read, so the design commits a
//! state root and requires a Merkle inclusion proof against it.
//!
//! ## What this module owns, and what it does not
//!
//! This module **builds and verifies proofs**. It does **not** decide whether a
//! root, a height or an identity is acceptable — `Chain` does, because it owns
//! the blocks that carry roots, the finality view that judges maturity and the
//! consumed-identity set that makes a release exactly-once. Splitting
//! proof-checking from chain-checking is what keeps a forged proof
//! cryptographically impossible even if a miner commits a lying root.
//!
//! The consensus rule that consumes these proofs is in `chain.rs`:
//! `Chain::check_claim` and `Chain::apply_one_claim` verify an exit record
//! against the `l2_state_root` the queue block committed, and `Block` carries
//! that root in `l2_state_root`. The activation gate is
//! `NetworkParams::exit_activation_height` — `0` means *never*, and below the
//! activation height a committed root is itself refused (`Chain::exit_active_at`).
//!
//! `crates/jnt-core/tests/sink_unspendable.rs` still holds the line that **no
//! signature** authorises a sink spend. That remains true: a release is
//! authorised by an inclusion proof against a committed root, not by a key —
//! which is why the sink needs no key at all.
//!
//! ## Construction
//!
//! Leaves are accounts, ordered by address, each hashed with its own domain tag
//! so an account leaf can never be reinterpreted as an L1 or L2 transaction
//! leaf (`block.rs` uses `0x00`/`0x02`; this uses [`ACCOUNT_LEAF_TAG`]).
//! Internal nodes use the same `0x01` internal tag as the block tree. The final
//! fold is wrapped in an explicit domain string, so a state root is not even
//! comparable to a block merkle root.
//!
//! Odd levels duplicate the last node, Bitcoin-style. That construction is
//! famously ambiguous when a verifier accepts an arbitrary depth
//! (CVE-2012-2459 shape), so [`verify_inclusion`] refuses a proof whose depth
//! does not match the committed leaf count and requires a duplicated node to
//! carry *itself* as its sibling. Without both checks, a 3-leaf tree and a
//! 4-leaf tree can share a root and a forged proof would still verify.
