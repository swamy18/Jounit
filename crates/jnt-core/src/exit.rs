//! L2 → L1 exit claims (approved P1, E-1…E-3, SPEC.md §19.6).
//!
//! A claim pays a matured, queued L2 exit out on L1. It consumes sink outputs
//! — real UTXOs with real value, so the ordinary `value_in >= value_out`
//! conservation rule holds unchanged — and is authorised by an **exit proof**,
//! not by a signature: a Merkle inclusion proof of the exit record against the
//! L2 state root the queue block committed.
//!
//! What this module does and does not do: it defines the claim shape, its
//! canonical codec, its identity and its gas, and it verifies a proof against
//! a *given* committed root. It does **not** decide whether a root, a height
//! or an identity is acceptable — that is the chain's job (`Chain` owns the
//! blocks that carry roots, the finality view that judges maturity, and the
//! consumed-identity set that makes a release exactly-once). Splitting
//! proof-checking from chain-checking is what keeps a forged proof
//! cryptographically impossible even if a miner commits a lying root: at
//! worst, exits from that queue block stall — the same one-way behaviour as
//! before exits existed — because no proof verifies against a root that does
//! not contain the record.
